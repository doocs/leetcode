# [262. Trips and Users](https://leetcode.com/problems/trips-and-users)



## Description

<p>Table: <code>Trips</code></p>

<pre>
+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| id          | int      |
| client_id   | int      |
| driver_id   | int      |
| city_id     | int      |
| status      | enum     |
| request_at  | date     |     
+-------------+----------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
The table holds all taxi trips. Each trip has a unique id, while client_id and driver_id are foreign keys to the users_id at the Users table.
Status is an ENUM (category) type of (&#39;completed&#39;, &#39;cancelled_by_driver&#39;, &#39;cancelled_by_client&#39;).
</pre>

<p>Table: <code>Users</code></p>

<pre>
+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| users_id    | int      |
| banned      | enum     |
| role        | enum     |
+-------------+----------+
users_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
The table holds all users. Each user has a unique users_id, and role is an ENUM type of (&#39;client&#39;, &#39;driver&#39;, &#39;partner&#39;).
banned is an ENUM (category) type of (&#39;Yes&#39;, &#39;No&#39;).
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <strong>cancellation rate</strong> is computed by dividing the number of canceled (by client or driver) requests with unbanned users by the total number of requests with unbanned users on that day.</p>

<p>Write a solution to find the <strong>cancellation rate</strong> of requests with unbanned users (<strong>both client and driver must not be banned</strong>) each day between <code>&quot;2013-10-01&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;2013-10-03&quot;</code>. Round <code>Cancellation Rate</code> to <strong>two decimal</strong> points.</p>

<p>Return the result table in <strong>any order</strong>.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;result format is in the following example.</p>

<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
On 2013-10-01:
  - There were 4 requests in total, 2 of which were canceled.
  - However, the request with Id=2 was made by a banned client (User_Id=2), so it is ignored in the calculation.
  - Hence there are 3 unbanned requests in total, 1 of which was canceled.
  - The Cancellation Rate is (1 / 3) = 0.33
On 2013-10-02:
  - There were 3 requests in total, 0 of which were canceled.
  - The request with Id=6 was made by a banned client, so it is ignored.
  - Hence there are 2 unbanned requests in total, 0 of which were canceled.
  - The Cancellation Rate is (0 / 2) = 0.00
On 2013-10-03:
  - There were 3 requests in total, 1 of which was canceled.
  - The request with Id=8 was made by a banned client, so it is ignored.
  - Hence there are 2 unbanned request in total, 1 of which were canceled.
  - The Cancellation Rate is (1 / 2) = 0.50

## Solutions

### Solution 1

=== "Python3"

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    
    
    def trips_and_users(trips: pd.DataFrame, users: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
        # 1) temporal filtering
        trips = trips[trips["request_at"].between("2013-10-01", "2013-10-03")].rename(
            columns={"request_at": "Day"}
        )
    
        # 2) filtering based not banned
        # 2.1) mappning the column 'banned' to `client_id` and `driver_id`
        df_client = (
            pd.merge(trips, users, left_on="client_id", right_on="users_id", how="left")
            .drop(["users_id", "role"], axis=1)
            .rename(columns={"banned": "banned_client"})
        )
        df_driver = (
            pd.merge(trips, users, left_on="driver_id", right_on="users_id", how="left")
            .drop(["users_id", "role"], axis=1)
            .rename(columns={"banned": "banned_driver"})
        )
        df = pd.merge(
            df_client,
            df_driver,
            left_on=["id", "driver_id", "client_id", "city_id", "status", "Day"],
            right_on=["id", "driver_id", "client_id", "city_id", "status", "Day"],
            how="left",
        )
        # 2.2) filtering based on not banned
        df = df[(df["banned_client"] == "No") & (df["banned_driver"] == "No")]
    
        # 3) counting the cancelled and total trips per day
        df["status_cancelled"] = df["status"].str.contains("cancelled")
        df = df[["Day", "status_cancelled"]]
        df = df.groupby("Day").agg(
            {"status_cancelled": [("total_cancelled", "sum"), ("total", "count")]}
        )
        df.columns = df.columns.droplevel()
        df = df.reset_index()
    
        # 4) calculating the ratio
        df["Cancellation Rate"] = (df["total_cancelled"] / df["total"]).round(2)
        return df[["Day", "Cancellation Rate"]]
    ```

=== "MySQL"

    ```sql
    # Write your MySQL query statement below
    SELECT
        request_at AS Day,
        ROUND(AVG(status != 'completed'), 2) AS 'Cancellation Rate'
    FROM
        Trips AS t
        JOIN Users AS u1 ON (t.client_id = u1.users_id AND u1.banned = 'No')
        JOIN Users AS u2 ON (t.driver_id = u2.users_id AND u2.banned = 'No')
    WHERE request_at BETWEEN '2013-10-01' AND '2013-10-03'
    GROUP BY request_at;
    ```
