# [1335. Minimum Difficulty of a Job Schedule](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-difficulty-of-a-job-schedule)



## Description

<p>You want to schedule a list of jobs in <code>d</code> days. Jobs are dependent (i.e To work on the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> job, you have to finish all the jobs <code>j</code> where <code>0 &lt;= j &lt; i</code>).</p>

<p>You have to finish <strong>at least</strong> one task every day. The difficulty of a job schedule is the sum of difficulties of each day of the <code>d</code> days. The difficulty of a day is the maximum difficulty of a job done on that day.</p>

<p>You are given an integer array <code>jobDifficulty</code> and an integer <code>d</code>. The difficulty of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> job is <code>jobDifficulty[i]</code>.</p>

<p>Return <em>the minimum difficulty of a job schedule</em>. If you cannot find a schedule for the jobs return <code>-1</code>.</p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> jobDifficulty = [6,5,4,3,2,1], d = 2
<strong>Output:</strong> 7
<strong>Explanation:</strong> First day you can finish the first 5 jobs, total difficulty = 6.
Second day you can finish the last job, total difficulty = 1.
The difficulty of the schedule = 6 + 1 = 7 
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> jobDifficulty = [9,9,9], d = 4
<strong>Output:</strong> -1
<strong>Explanation:</strong> If you finish a job per day you will still have a free day. you cannot find a schedule for the given jobs.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> jobDifficulty = [1,1,1], d = 3
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The schedule is one job per day. total difficulty will be 3.
</pre>

<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= jobDifficulty.length &lt;= 300</code></li>
	<li><code>0 &lt;= jobDifficulty[i] &lt;= 1000</code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= d &lt;= 10</code></li>

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Dynamic Programming

We define $f[i][j]$ as the minimum difficulty to finish the first $i$ jobs within $j$ days. Initially $f[0][0] = 0$, and all other $f[i][j]$ are $\infty$.

For the $j$-th day, we can choose to finish jobs $[k,..i]$ on this day. Therefore, we have the following state transition equation:

$$
f[i][j] = \min_{k \in [1,i]} \{f[k-1][j-1] + \max_{k \leq t \leq i} \{jobDifficulty[t]\}\}
$$

The final answer is $f[n][d]$.

The time complexity is $O(n^2 \times d)$, and the space complexity is $O(n \times d)$. Here $n$ and $d$ are the number of jobs and the number of days respectively.
