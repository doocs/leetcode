## Description

<p>Table: <code>Employee</code></p>

<pre>
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| id           | int     |
| name         | varchar |
| salary       | int     |
| departmentId | int     |
+--------------+---------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
departmentId is a foreign key (reference columns) of the ID from the <code>Department </code>table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID, name, and salary of an employee. It also contains the ID of their department.

+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table. It is guaranteed that department name is not <code>NULL.</code>
Each row of this table indicates the ID of a department and its name.

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Equi-Join + Subquery

We can use an equi-join to join the `Employee` table and the `Department` table based on `Employee.departmentId = Department.id`, and then use a subquery to find the highest salary for each department. Finally, we can use a `WHERE` clause to filter out the employees with the highest salary in each department.

=== "MySQL"

    ```sql
    # Write your MySQL query statement below
    SELECT d.name AS department, e.name AS employee, salary
    FROM
        Employee AS e
        JOIN Department AS d ON e.departmentId = d.id
    WHERE
        (d.id, salary) IN (
            SELECT departmentId, MAX(salary)
            FROM Employee
            GROUP BY 1
        );
    ```


### Solution 2: Equi-Join + Window Function

We can use an equi-join to join the `Employee` table and the `Department` table based on `Employee.departmentId = Department.id`, and then use the window function `rank()`, which assigns a rank to each employee in each department based on their salary. Finally, we can select the rows with a rank of $1$ for each department.

=== "MySQL"

    ```sql
    # Write your MySQL query statement below
    WITH
        T AS (
            SELECT
                d.name AS department,
                e.name AS employee,
                salary,
                RANK() OVER (
                    PARTITION BY d.name
                    ORDER BY salary DESC
                ) AS rk
            FROM
                Employee AS e
                JOIN Department AS d ON e.departmentId = d.id
        )
    SELECT department, employee, salary
    FROM T
    WHERE rk = 1;
    ```
