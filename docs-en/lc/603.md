# [603. Consecutive Available Seats](https://leetcode.com/problems/consecutive-available-seats)



## Description

<p>Table: <code>Cinema</code></p>

<pre>
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| seat_id     | int  |
| free        | bool |
+-------------+------+
seat_id is an auto-increment column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates whether the i<sup>th</sup> seat is free or not. 1 means free while 0 means occupied.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Find all the consecutive available seats in the cinema.</p>

<p>Return the result table <strong>ordered</strong> by <code>seat_id</code> <strong>in ascending order</strong>.</p>

<p>The test cases are generated so that more than two seats are consecutively available.</p>

<p>The result format is in the following example.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

| 3       | 1    |
| 4       | 1    |
| 5       | 1    |

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Self-Join

We can use a self-join to join the `Seat` table with itself, and then filter out the records where the `id` of the left seat is equal to the `id` of the right seat minus $1$, and where both seats are empty.

=== "MySQL"

    ```sql
    # Write your MySQL query statement below
    SELECT DISTINCT a.seat_id
    FROM
        Cinema AS a
        JOIN Cinema AS b ON ABS(a.seat_id - b.seat_id) = 1 AND a.free AND b.free
    ORDER BY 1;
    ```


### Solution 2: Window Function

We can use the `LAG` and `LEAD` functions (or `SUM() OVER(ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND 1 FOLLOWING)`) to obtain the information of adjacent seats, and then filter out the consecutive empty seats and sort them in a unique way.

=== "MySQL"

    ```sql
    # Write your MySQL query statement below
    WITH
        T AS (
            SELECT
                seat_id,
                (free + (LAG(free) OVER (ORDER BY seat_id))) AS a,
                (free + (LEAD(free) OVER (ORDER BY seat_id))) AS b
            FROM Cinema
        )
    SELECT seat_id
    FROM T
    WHERE a = 2 OR b = 2;
    ```


### Solution 3

=== "MySQL"

    ```sql
    # Write your MySQL query statement below
    WITH
        T AS (
            SELECT
                *,
                SUM(free = 1) OVER (
                    ORDER BY seat_id
                    ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND 1 FOLLOWING
                ) AS cnt
            FROM Cinema
        )
    SELECT seat_id
    FROM T
    WHERE free = 1 AND cnt > 1
    ORDER BY 1;
    ```
