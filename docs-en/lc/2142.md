## Description

<p>Table: <code>Buses</code></p>

<pre>
+--------------+------+
| Column Name  | Type |
+--------------+------+
| bus_id       | int  |
| arrival_time | int  |
+--------------+------+
bus_id is the column with unique values for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the arrival time of a bus at the LeetCode station.
No two buses will arrive at the same time.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Table: <code>Passengers</code></p>

<pre>
+--------------+------+
| Column Name  | Type |
+--------------+------+
| passenger_id | int  |
| arrival_time | int  |
+--------------+------+
passenger_id is the column with unique values for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the arrival time of a passenger at the LeetCode station.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Buses and passengers arrive at the LeetCode station. If a bus arrives at the station at time <code>t<sub>bus</sub></code> and a passenger arrived at time <code>t<sub>passenger</sub></code> where <code>t<sub>passenger</sub> &lt;= t<sub>bus</sub></code> and the passenger did not catch any bus, the passenger will use that bus.</p>

<p>Write a solution&nbsp;to report the number of users that used each bus.</p>

<p>Return the result table ordered by <code>bus_id</code> in <strong>ascending order</strong>.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;result format is in the following example.</p>

<strong>Input:</strong> 
Buses table:
+--------+--------------+
| bus_id | arrival_time |
+--------+--------------+
| 1      | 2            |
| 2      | 4            |
| 3      | 7            |
+--------+--------------+
Passengers table:
+--------------+--------------+
| passenger_id | arrival_time |
+--------------+--------------+
| 11           | 1            |
| 12           | 5            |
| 13           | 6            |
| 14           | 7            |
+--------------+--------------+
<strong>Output:</strong> 
+--------+----------------+
| bus_id | passengers_cnt |
+--------+----------------+
| 1      | 1              |
| 2      | 0              |
| 3      | 3              |
+--------+----------------+
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
- Passenger 11 arrives at time 1.
- Bus 1 arrives at time 2 and collects passenger 11.

- Bus 2 arrives at time 4 and does not collect any passengers.

- Passenger 12 arrives at time 5.
- Passenger 13 arrives at time 6.
- Passenger 14 arrives at time 7.
- Bus 3 arrives at time 7 and collects passengers 12, 13, and 14.

## Solutions

### Solution 1

=== "MySQL"

    ```sql
    # Write your MySQL query statement below
    SELECT
        bus_id,
        COUNT(passenger_id) - LAG(COUNT(passenger_id), 1, 0) OVER (
            ORDER BY b.arrival_time
        ) AS passengers_cnt
    FROM
        Buses AS b
        LEFT JOIN Passengers AS p ON p.arrival_time <= b.arrival_time
    GROUP BY 1
    ORDER BY 1;
    ```
