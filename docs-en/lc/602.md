<strong>Input:</strong> 
RequestAccepted table:
+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| requester_id | accepter_id | accept_date |
+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| 1            | 2           | 2016/06/03  |
| 1            | 3           | 2016/06/08  |
| 2            | 3           | 2016/06/08  |

| id | num |
+----+-----+
| 3  | 3   |
