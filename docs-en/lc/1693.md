There is no primary key (column with unique values) for this table. It may contain duplicates.
This table contains the date and the name of the product sold and the IDs of the lead and partner it was sold to.
The name consists of only lowercase English letters.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For each <code>date_id</code> and <code>make_name</code>, find the number of <strong>distinct</strong> <code>lead_id</code>&#39;s and <strong>distinct</strong> <code>partner_id</code>&#39;s.</p>

<p>Return the result table in <strong>any order</strong>.</p>

<strong>Input:</strong> 
DailySales table:
+-----------+-----------+---------+------------+
| date_id   | make_name | lead_id | partner_id |
+-----------+-----------+---------+------------+
| 2020-12-8 | toyota    | 0       | 1          |
| 2020-12-8 | toyota    | 1       | 0          |
| 2020-12-8 | toyota    | 1       | 2          |
| 2020-12-7 | toyota    | 0       | 2          |
| 2020-12-7 | toyota    | 0       | 1          |
| 2020-12-8 | honda     | 1       | 2          |
| 2020-12-8 | honda     | 2       | 1          |
| 2020-12-7 | honda     | 0       | 1          |
| 2020-12-7 | honda     | 1       | 2          |
| 2020-12-7 | honda     | 2       | 1          |
+-----------+-----------+---------+------------+
<strong>Output:</strong> 
+-----------+-----------+--------------+-----------------+
| date_id   | make_name | unique_leads | unique_partners |
+-----------+-----------+--------------+-----------------+
| 2020-12-8 | toyota    | 2            | 3               |
| 2020-12-7 | toyota    | 1            | 2               |
| 2020-12-8 | honda     | 2            | 2               |
| 2020-12-7 | honda     | 3            | 2               |
+-----------+-----------+--------------+-----------------+
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
For 2020-12-8, toyota gets leads = [0, 1] and partners = [0, 1, 2] while honda gets leads = [1, 2] and partners = [1, 2].
For 2020-12-7, toyota gets leads = [0] and partners = [1, 2] while honda gets leads = [0, 1, 2] and partners = [1, 2].

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Group By + Count Distinct

We can use the `GROUP BY` statement to group the data by the `date_id` and `make_name` fields, and then use the `COUNT(DISTINCT)` function to count the number of distinct values for `lead_id` and `partner_id`.

=== "MySQL"

    ```sql
    # Write your MySQL query statement below
    SELECT
        date_id,
        make_name,
        COUNT(DISTINCT lead_id) AS unique_leads,
        COUNT(DISTINCT partner_id) AS unique_partners
    FROM DailySales
    GROUP BY 1, 2;
    ```
