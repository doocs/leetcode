## Solutions

### Solution 1: Mathematics

The problem is actually asking for the number of factors of $5$ in $[1,n]$.

Let's take $130$ as an example:

1. Divide $130$ by $5$ for the first time, and get $26$, which means there are $26$ numbers containing a factor of $5$.
2. Divide $26$ by $5$ for the second time, and get $5$, which means there are $5$ numbers containing a factor of $5^2$.
3. Divide $5$ by $5$ for the third time, and get $1$, which means there is $1$ number containing a factor of $5^3$.
4. Add up all the counts to get the total number of factors of $5$ in $[1,n]$.

The time complexity is $O(\log n)$, and the space complexity is $O(1)$.
