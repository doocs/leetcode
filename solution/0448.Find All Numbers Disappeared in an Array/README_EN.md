# Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array

Given an array of integers where **1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n** (n = _size of array_), some elements appear twice and others appear once.

Find all the elements of [1, _n_] inclusive that do not appear in this array.

Could you do it without extra space and in O(_n_) runtime? You may assume the returned list does not count as extra space.

## Example:
```
 Input: [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
 Output: [5,6]
```
