## Description

<p>Table: <code>Boxes</code></p>

<pre>
+--------------+------+
| Column Name  | Type |
+--------------+------+
| box_id       | int  |
| chest_id     | int  |
| apple_count  | int  |
| orange_count | int  |
+--------------+------+
box_id is the primary key for this table.
chest_id is a foreign key of the chests table.
This table contains information about the boxes and the number of oranges and apples they have. Each box may include a chest, which also can contain oranges and apples.
</pre>

<p>Table: <code>Chests</code></p>

<pre>
+--------------+------+
| Column Name  | Type |
+--------------+------+
| chest_id     | int  |
| apple_count  | int  |
| orange_count | int  |
+--------------+------+
chest_id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the chests and the corresponding number of oranges and apples they have.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Write an SQL query to count the number of apples and oranges in all the boxes. If a box contains a chest, you should also include the number of apples and oranges it has.</p>

| 2      | null     | 6           | 15           |

+----------+-------------+--------------+
<strong>Output:</strong> 
+-------------+--------------+
| apple_count | orange_count |
+-------------+--------------+
| 151         | 123          |
+-------------+--------------+
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
box 2 has 6 apples and 15 oranges.
box 18 has 4 + 20 (from the chest) = 24 apples and 15 + 10 (from the chest) = 25 oranges.
box 19 has 8 + 19 (from the chest) = 27 apples and 4 + 4 (from the chest) = 8 oranges.
box 12 has 19 + 8 (from the chest) = 27 apples and 20 + 8 (from the chest) = 28 oranges.
box 20 has 12 + 5 (from the chest) = 17 apples and 9 + 6 (from the chest) = 15 oranges.
box 8 has 9 + 5 (from the chest) = 14 apples and 9 + 6 (from the chest) = 15 oranges.
box 3 has 16 + 20 (from the chest) = 36 apples and 7 + 10 (from the chest) = 17 oranges.
Total number of apples = 6 + 24 + 27 + 27 + 17 + 14 + 36 = 151
Total number of oranges = 15 + 25 + 8 + 28 + 15 + 15 + 17 = 123

## Solutions

<!-- tabs:start -->

`LEFT JOIN` and `IFNULL`.

### **SQL**

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT
    SUM(IFNULL(b.apple_count, 0) + IFNULL(c.apple_count, 0)) AS apple_count,
    SUM(IFNULL(b.orange_count, 0) + IFNULL(c.orange_count, 0)) AS orange_count
FROM
    Boxes b
LEFT JOIN
    Chests c
ON
    b.chest_id = c.chest_id;
```
