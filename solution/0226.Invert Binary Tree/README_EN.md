# Invert Binary Tree

Invert a binary tree.

## Example:
```
 Input:
 
      4
    /   \
   2     7
  / \   / \
 1   3 6   9
 Output:
 
      4
    /   \
   7     2
  / \   / \
 9   6 3   1
```

##Trivia:
This problem was inspired by this original tweet by Max Howell:

```
Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you can’t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so f*** off.
