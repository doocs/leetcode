<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> 
Product table:

<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
The product with id 1 was only sold in the spring of 2019.
The product with id 2 was sold in the spring of 2019 but was also sold after the spring of 2019.
The product with id 3 was sold after spring 2019.
We return only product 1 as it is the product that was only sold in the spring of 2019.
