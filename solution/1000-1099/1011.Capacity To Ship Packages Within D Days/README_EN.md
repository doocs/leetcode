# [1011. Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days](https://leetcode.com/problems/capacity-to-ship-packages-within-d-days)

[中文文档](/solution/1000-1099/1011.Capacity%20To%20Ship%20Packages%20Within%20D%20Days/README.md)

## Description

<p>A conveyor belt has packages that must be shipped from one port to another within <code>days</code> days.</p>

<p>The <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> package on the conveyor belt has a weight of <code>weights[i]</code>. Each day, we load the ship with packages on the conveyor belt (in the order given by <code>weights</code>). We may not load more weight than the maximum weight capacity of the ship.</p>

<p>Return the least weight capacity of the ship that will result in all the packages on the conveyor belt being shipped within <code>days</code> days.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> weights = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], days = 5
<strong>Output:</strong> 15
<strong>Explanation:</strong> A ship capacity of 15 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 5 days like this:
1st day: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
2nd day: 6, 7
3rd day: 8
4th day: 9
5th day: 10

Note that the cargo must be shipped in the order given, so using a ship of capacity 14 and splitting the packages into parts like (2, 3, 4, 5), (1, 6, 7), (8), (9), (10) is not allowed.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> weights = [3,2,2,4,1,4], days = 3
<strong>Output:</strong> 6
<strong>Explanation:</strong> A ship capacity of 6 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 3 days like this:
1st day: 3, 2
2nd day: 2, 4
3rd day: 1, 4
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> weights = [1,2,3,1,1], days = 4
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
1st day: 1
2nd day: 2
3rd day: 3
4th day: 1, 1
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= days &lt;= weights.length &lt;= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= weights[i] &lt;= 500</code></li>
</ul>

### **Python3**

```python
class Solution:
    def shipWithinDays(self, weights: List[int], days: int) -> int:
        def check(mx):
            ws, cnt = 0, 1
            for w in weights:
                ws += w
                if ws > mx:
                    cnt += 1
                    ws = w
            return cnt <= days

        left, right = max(weights), sum(weights) + 1
        return left + bisect_left(range(left, right), True, key=check)
```

### **Java**

```java
class Solution {
    public int shipWithinDays(int[] weights, int days) {
        int left = 0, right = 0;
        for (int w : weights) {
            left = Math.max(left, w);
            right += w;
        }
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = (left + right) >> 1;
            if (check(mid, weights, days)) {
                right = mid;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return left;
    }

    private boolean check(int mx, int[] weights, int days) {
        int ws = 0, cnt = 1;
        for (int w : weights) {
            ws += w;
            if (ws > mx) {
                ws = w;

### **C++**

```cpp

        int left = 0, right = 0;
        for (auto& w : weights) {
