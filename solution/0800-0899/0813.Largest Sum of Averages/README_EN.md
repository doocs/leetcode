# [813. Largest Sum of Averages](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-sum-of-averages)

[中文文档](/solution/0800-0899/0813.Largest%20Sum%20of%20Averages/README.md)

## Description

<p>We partition a row of numbers <code>A</code>&nbsp;into at most <code>K</code> adjacent (non-empty) groups, then our score is the sum of the average of each group. What is the largest score we can achieve?</p>

<p>Note that our partition must use every number in A, and that scores are not necessarily integers.</p>

<pre>

<strong>Example:</strong>

<strong>Input:</strong> 

A = [9,1,2,3,9]

K = 3

<strong>Output:</strong> 20

<strong>Explanation:</strong> 

The best choice is to partition A into [9], [1, 2, 3], [9]. The answer is 9 + (1 + 2 + 3) / 3 + 9 = 20.

We could have also partitioned A into [9, 1], [2], [3, 9], for example.

That partition would lead to a score of 5 + 2 + 6 = 13, which is worse.

<p><strong>Note: </strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= A.length &lt;= 100</code>.</li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= A[i] &lt;= 10000</code>.</li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= K &lt;= A.length</code>.</li>
	<li>Answers within <code>10^-6</code> of the correct answer will be accepted as correct.</li>
</ul>
