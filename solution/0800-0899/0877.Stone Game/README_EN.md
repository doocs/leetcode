# [877. Stone Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/stone-game)

[中文文档](/solution/0800-0899/0877.Stone%20Game/README.md)

## Description

<p>Alex and Lee play a game with piles of stones.&nbsp; There are an even number of&nbsp;piles <strong>arranged in a row</strong>, and each pile has a positive integer number of stones <code>piles[i]</code>.</p>

<p>The objective of the game is to end with the most&nbsp;stones.&nbsp; The total number of stones is odd, so there are no ties.</p>

<p>Alex and Lee take turns, with Alex starting first.&nbsp; Each turn, a player&nbsp;takes the entire pile of stones from either the beginning or the end of the row.&nbsp; This continues until there are no more piles left, at which point the person with the most stones wins.</p>

<p>Assuming Alex and Lee play optimally, return <code>True</code>&nbsp;if and only if Alex wins the game.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> piles = [5,3,4,5]
<strong>Output:</strong> true
<strong>Explanation: </strong>
Alex starts first, and can only take the first 5 or the last 5.
Say he takes the first 5, so that the row becomes [3, 4, 5].
If Lee takes 3, then the board is [4, 5], and Alex takes 5 to win with 10 points.
If Lee takes the last 5, then the board is [3, 4], and Alex takes 4 to win with 9 points.
This demonstrated that taking the first 5 was a winning move for Alex, so we return true.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>2 &lt;= piles.length &lt;= 500</code></li>
	<li><code>piles.length</code> is even.</li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= piles[i] &lt;= 500</code></li>
	<li><code>sum(piles)</code> is odd.</li>
</ul>
