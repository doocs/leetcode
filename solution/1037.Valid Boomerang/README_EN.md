# Valid Boomerang

A boomerang is a set of 3 points that are all distinct and not in a straight line.

Given a list of three points in the plane, return whether these points are a boomerang.



## Example 1:
```text
Input: [[1,1],[2,3],[3,2]]
Output: true
```

## Example 2:
```text
Input: [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]]
Output: false
```

## Note:

- points.length == 3
- points[i].length == 2
- 0 <= points[i][j] <= 100
