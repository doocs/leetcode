## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>Table: <code>Orders</code></p>

<pre>
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| order_id      | int     |
| order_date    | date    |
| customer_id   | int     |
| invoice       | int     |
+---------------+---------+
order_id is the column with unique values for this table.
This table contains information about the orders made by customer_id.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Write a solution to find the number of <strong>unique orders</strong> and the number of <strong>unique customers</strong> with invoices <strong>&gt; $20</strong> for each <strong>different month</strong>.</p>

<p>Return the result table sorted in <strong>any order</strong>.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;result format is in the following example.</p>

<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
In September 2020 we have two orders from 2 different customers with invoices &gt; $20.
In October 2020 we have two orders from 1 customer, and only one of the two orders has invoice &gt; $20.
In November 2020 we have two orders from 2 different customers but invoices &lt; $20, so we don&#39;t include that month.
In December 2020 we have two orders from 1 customer both with invoices &gt; $20.
In January 2021 we have two orders from 2 different customers, but only one of them with invoice &gt; $20.

## Solutions

<!-- solution:start -->

### Solution 1: Conditional Filtering + Grouping Statistics

We can first filter out orders with an amount greater than $20$, and then group by month to count the number of orders and customers.

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### MySQL

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT
    DATE_FORMAT(order_date, '%Y-%m') AS month,
    COUNT(order_id) AS order_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS customer_count
FROM Orders
WHERE invoice > 20
GROUP BY 1;
```

#### Pandas

```python
import pandas as pd


def unique_orders_and_customers(orders: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    filtered_orders = orders[orders["invoice"] > 20]
    filtered_orders["month"] = (
        filtered_orders["order_date"].dt.to_period("M").astype(str)
    )
    result = (
        filtered_orders.groupby("month")
        .agg(
            order_count=("order_id", "count"), customer_count=("customer_id", "nunique")
        )
        .reset_index()
    )
    return result
```
