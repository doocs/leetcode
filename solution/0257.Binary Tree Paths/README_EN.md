# Binary Tree Paths

Given a binary tree, return all root-to-leaf paths.

## Note: A leaf is a node with no children.


## Example :
```
    Input:
    
       1
     /   \
    2     3
     \
      5
    
    Output: ["1->2->5", "1->3"]
    
    Explanation: All root-to-leaf paths are: 1->2->5, 1->3
    
```
