# Invert Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the **longest** path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

## Example:
```
 Given a binary tree:
           1
          / \
         2   3
        / \     
       4   5    
```
Return 3, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

## Note:
 The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.
