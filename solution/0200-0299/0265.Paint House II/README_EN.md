[中文文档](/solution/0200-0299/0265.Paint%20House%20II/README.md)

## Description

<p>There are a row of <i>n</i> houses, each house can be painted with one of the <i>k</i> colors. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.</p>

<p>The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a <code><i>n</i> x <i>k</i></code> cost matrix. For example, <code>costs[0][0]</code> is the cost of painting house 0 with color 0; <code>costs[1][2]</code> is the cost of painting house 1 with color 2, and so on... Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b><br />
All costs are positive integers.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> [[1,5,3],[2,9,4]]
<strong>Output:</strong> 5
<strong>Explanation: </strong>Paint house 0 into color 0, paint house 1 into color 2. Minimum cost: 1 + 4 = 5; 
             Or paint house 0 into color 2, paint house 1 into color 0. Minimum cost: 3 + 2 = 5.
