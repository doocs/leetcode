# [210. Course Schedule II](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-ii)

## Description
<p>There are a total of <em>n</em> courses you have to take, labeled from <code>0</code> to <code>n-1</code>.</p>



<p>Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: <code>[0,1]</code></p>



<p>Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite <strong>pairs</strong>, return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses.</p>



<p>There may be multiple correct orders, you just need to return one of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.</p>



<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>



<pre>

<strong>Input:</strong> 2, [[1,0]] 

<strong>Output: </strong><code>[0,1]</code>

<strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished   

&nbsp;            course 0. So the correct course order is <code>[0,1] .</code></pre>



<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>



<pre>

<strong>Input:</strong> 4, [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]

<strong>Output: </strong><code>[0,1,2,3] or [0,2,1,3]</code>

<strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both     

             courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0. 

&nbsp;            So one correct course order is <code>[0,1,2,3]</code>. Another correct ordering is <code>[0,2,1,3] .</code></pre>



<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>



<ol>

	<li>The input prerequisites is a graph represented by <strong>a list of edges</strong>, not adjacency matrices. Read more about <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/graph-representation/a/representing-graphs" target="_blank">how a graph is represented</a>.</li>

	<li>You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.</li>
