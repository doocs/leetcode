## Description

<p>Table: <code>Trips</code></p>

<pre>
+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| Id          | int      |
| Client_Id   | int      |
| Driver_Id   | int      |
| City_Id     | int      |
| Status      | enum     |
| Request_at  | date     |     
+-------------+----------+
Id is the primary key for this table.
The table holds all taxi trips. Each trip has a unique Id, while Client_Id and Driver_Id are foreign keys to the Users_Id at the Users table.
Status is an ENUM type of (&lsquo;completed&rsquo;, &lsquo;cancelled_by_driver&rsquo;, &lsquo;cancelled_by_client&rsquo;).
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Table: <code>Users</code></p>

<pre>
+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| Users_Id    | int      |
| Banned      | enum     |
| Role        | enum     |
+-------------+----------+
Users_Id is the primary key for this table.
The table holds all users. Each user has a unique Users_Id, and Role is an ENUM type of (&lsquo;client&rsquo;, &lsquo;driver&rsquo;, &lsquo;partner&rsquo;).
Status is an ENUM type of (&lsquo;Yes&rsquo;, &lsquo;No&rsquo;).
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Write a SQL query to find the <strong>cancellation rate</strong> of requests with unbanned users (<strong>both client and driver must not be banned</strong>) each day between <code>&quot;2013-10-01&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;2013-10-03&quot;</code>.</p>

<p>The <strong>cancellation rate</strong> is computed by dividing the number of canceled (by client or driver) requests with unbanned users by the total number of requests with unbanned users on that day.</p>

<p>Return the result table in any order. Round <code>Cancellation Rate</code> to <strong>two decimal</strong> points.</p>

<p>The query result format is in the following example:</p>

Result table:

| Day        | Cancellation Rate |

| 2013-10-01 | 0.33              |

+------------+-------------------+

On 2013-10-01:
  - There were 4 requests in total, 2 of which were canceled.
  - However, the request with Id=2 was made by a banned client (User_Id=2), so it is ignored in the calculation.
  - Hence there are 3 unbanned requests in total, 1 of which was canceled.
  - The Cancellation Rate is (1 / 3) = 0.33
On 2013-10-02:
  - There were 3 requests in total, 0 of which were canceled.
  - The request with Id=6 was made by a banned client, so it is ignored.
  - Hence there are 2 unbanned requests in total, 0 of which were canceled.
  - The Cancellation Rate is (0 / 2) = 0.00
On 2013-10-03:
  - There were 3 requests in total, 1 of which was canceled.
  - The request with Id=8 was made by a banned client, so it is ignored.
  - Hence there are 2 unbanned request in total, 1 of which were canceled.
  - The Cancellation Rate is (1 / 2) = 0.50
