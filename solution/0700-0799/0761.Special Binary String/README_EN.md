# [761. Special Binary String](https://leetcode.com/problems/special-binary-string)

[中文文档](/solution/0700-0799/0761.Special%20Binary%20String/README.md)

## Description

<p>

<i>Special</i> binary strings are binary strings with the following two properties:

</p><p>

<li>The number of 0's is equal to the number of 1's.</li>

<li>Every prefix of the binary string has at least as many 1's as 0's.</li>

</p><p>

Given a special string <code>S</code>, a <i>move</i> consists of choosing two consecutive, non-empty, special substrings of <code>S</code>, and swapping them. <i>(Two strings are consecutive if the last character of the first string is exactly one index before the first character of the second string.)</i>

</p><p>

At the end of any number of moves, what is the lexicographically largest resulting string possible?

</p>

<p><b>Example 1:</b><br />

<pre>

<b>Input:</b> S = "11011000"

<b>Output:</b> "11100100"

<b>Explanation:</b>

The strings "10" [occuring at S[1]] and "1100" [at S[3]] are swapped.

This is the lexicographically largest string possible after some number of swaps.

</pre>

</p>

<p><b>Note:</b><ol>

<li><code>S</code> has length at most <code>50</code>.</li>

<li><code>S</code> is guaranteed to be a <i>special</i> binary string as defined above.</li>

</ol></p>
