[中文文档](/solution/0700-0799/0762.Prime%20Number%20of%20Set%20Bits%20in%20Binary%20Representation/README.md)

## Description

<p>

Given two integers <code>L</code> and <code>R</code>, find the count of numbers in the range <code>[L, R]</code> (inclusive) having a prime number of set bits in their binary representation.

</p><p>

(Recall that the number of set bits an integer has is the number of <code>1</code>s present when written in binary. For example, <code>21</code> written in binary is <code>10101</code> which has 3 set bits. Also, 1 is not a prime.)

</p><p>

<p><b>Example 1:</b><br /><pre>

<b>Input:</b> L = 6, R = 10

<b>Output:</b> 4

<b>Explanation:</b>

6 -> 110 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)

7 -> 111 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)

9 -> 1001 (2 set bits , 2 is prime)

10->1010 (2 set bits , 2 is prime)

</pre></p>

<p><b>Example 2:</b><br /><pre>

<b>Input:</b> L = 10, R = 15

<b>Output:</b> 5

<b>Explanation:</b>

10 -> 1010 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)

11 -> 1011 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)

12 -> 1100 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)

13 -> 1101 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)

14 -> 1110 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)

15 -> 1111 (4 set bits, 4 is not prime)

</pre></p>

<p><b>Note:</b><br><ol>

<li><code>L, R</code> will be integers <code>L <= R</code> in the range <code>[1, 10^6]</code>.</li>

<li><code>R - L</code> will be at most 10000.</li>

</ol></p>
