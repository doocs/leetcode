# [739. Daily Temperatures](https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures)

## Description
<p>
Given a list of daily temperatures <code>T</code>, return a list such that, for each day in the input, tells you how many days you would have to wait until a warmer temperature.  If there is no future day for which this is possible, put <code>0</code> instead.
</p><p>
For example, given the list of temperatures <code>T = [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73]</code>, your output should be <code>[1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0]</code>.
</p>

<p><b>Note:</b>
The length of <code>temperatures</code> will be in the range <code>[1, 30000]</code>.
Each temperature will be an integer in the range <code>[30, 100]</code>.
