# [781. Rabbits in Forest](https://leetcode.com/problems/rabbits-in-forest)

## Description
<p>In a forest, each rabbit has some color. Some subset of rabbits (possibly all of them) tell you how many other rabbits have the same color as them. Those <code>answers</code> are placed in an array.</p>

<p>Return the minimum number of rabbits that could be in the forest.</p>

<pre>
<strong>Examples:</strong>
<strong>Input:</strong> answers = [1, 1, 2]
<strong>Output:</strong> 5
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
The two rabbits that answered &quot;1&quot; could both be the same color, say red.
The rabbit than answered &quot;2&quot; can&#39;t be red or the answers would be inconsistent.
Say the rabbit that answered &quot;2&quot; was blue.
Then there should be 2 other blue rabbits in the forest that didn&#39;t answer into the array.
The smallest possible number of rabbits in the forest is therefore 5: 3 that answered plus 2 that didn&#39;t.

<strong>Input:</strong> answers = [10, 10, 10]
<strong>Output:</strong> 11

<strong>Input:</strong> answers = []
<strong>Output:</strong> 0

<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li><code>answers</code> will have length at most <code>1000</code>.</li>
	<li>Each <code>answers[i]</code> will be an integer in the range <code>[0, 999]</code>.</li>
