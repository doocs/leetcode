# [717. 1-bit and 2-bit Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/1-bit-and-2-bit-characters)

[中文文档](/solution/0700-0799/0717.1-bit%20and%202-bit%20Characters/README.md)

## Description

<p>We have two special characters. The first character can be represented by one bit <code>0</code>. The second character can be represented by two bits (<code>10</code> or <code>11</code>).  </p>

<p>Now given a string represented by several bits. Return whether the last character must be a one-bit character or not. The given string will always end with a zero.</p>

<p><b>Example 1:</b><br />

<pre>

<b>Input:</b> 

bits = [1, 0, 0]

<b>Output:</b> True

<b>Explanation:</b> 

The only way to decode it is two-bit character and one-bit character. So the last character is one-bit character.

</pre>

</p>

<p><b>Example 2:</b><br />

<pre>

<b>Input:</b> 

bits = [1, 1, 1, 0]

<b>Output:</b> False

<b>Explanation:</b> 

The only way to decode it is two-bit character and two-bit character. So the last character is NOT one-bit character.

</pre>

</p>

<p><b>Note:</b>

<li><code>1 <= len(bits) <= 1000</code>.</li>

<li><code>bits[i]</code> is always <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>.</li>

</p>
