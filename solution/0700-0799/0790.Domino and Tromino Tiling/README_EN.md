[中文文档](/solution/0700-0799/0790.Domino%20and%20Tromino%20Tiling/README.md)

## Description

<p>We have two types of tiles: a 2x1 domino shape, and an &quot;L&quot; tromino shape. These shapes may be rotated.</p>

<pre>

XX  &lt;- domino



XX  &lt;- &quot;L&quot; tromino

X

</pre>

<p>Given N, how many ways are there to tile a 2 x N board? <strong>Return your answer modulo 10^9 + 7</strong>.</p>

<p>(In a tiling, every square must be covered by a tile. Two tilings are different if and only if there are two 4-directionally adjacent cells on the board such that exactly one of the tilings has both squares occupied by a tile.)</p>

<pre>

<strong>Example:</strong>

<strong>Input:</strong> 3

<strong>Output:</strong> 5

<strong>Explanation:</strong> 

The five different ways are listed below, different letters indicates different tiles:

XYZ XXZ XYY XXY XYY

XYZ YYZ XZZ XYY XXY</pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>N&nbsp; will be in range <code>[1, 1000]</code>.</li>
</ul>
