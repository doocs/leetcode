## Solutions

### Solution 1: Dynamic Programming

First, we need to understand the problem. The problem is essentially asking us to find the number of ways to tile a $2 \times n$ board, where each square on the board can only be covered by one tile.

There are two types of tiles: `2 x 1` and `L` shapes, and both types of tiles can be rotated. We denote the rotated tiles as `1 x 2` and `L'` shapes.

We define $f[i][j]$ to represent the number of ways to tile the first $2 \times i$ board, where $j$ represents the state of the last column. The last column has 4 states:

-   The last column is fully covered, denoted as $0$
-   The last column has only the top square covered, denoted as $1$
-   The last column has only the bottom square covered, denoted as $2$
-   The last column is not covered, denoted as $3$

The answer is $f[n][0]$. Initially, $f[0][0] = 1$ and the rest $f[0][j] = 0$.

We consider tiling up to the $i$-th column and look at the state transition equations:

When $j = 0$, the last column is fully covered. It can be transitioned from the previous column's states $0, 1, 2, 3$ by placing the corresponding tiles, i.e., $f[i-1][0]$ with a `1 x 2` tile, $f[i-1][1]$ with an `L'` tile, $f[i-1][2]$ with an `L'` tile, or $f[i-1][3]$ with two `2 x 1` tiles. Therefore, $f[i][0] = \sum_{j=0}^3 f[i-1][j]$.

When $j = 1$, the last column has only the top square covered. It can be transitioned from the previous column's states $2, 3$ by placing a `2 x 1` tile or an `L` tile. Therefore, $f[i][1] = f[i-1][2] + f[i-1][3]$.

When $j = 2$, the last column has only the bottom square covered. It can be transitioned from the previous column's states $1, 3$ by placing a `2 x 1` tile or an `L'` tile. Therefore, $f[i][2] = f[i-1][1] + f[i-1][3]$.

When $j = 3$, the last column is not covered. It can be transitioned from the previous column's state $0$. Therefore, $f[i][3] = f[i-1][0]$.

We can see that the state transition equations only involve the previous column's states, so we can use a rolling array to optimize the space complexity.

Note that the values of the states can be very large, so we need to take modulo $10^9 + 7$.

The time complexity is $O(n)$, and the space complexity is $O(1)$. Where $n$ is the number of columns of the board.

#### Python3

```python
class Solution:
    def numTilings(self, n: int) -> int:
        f = [1, 0, 0, 0]
        mod = 10**9 + 7
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            g = [0] * 4
            g[0] = (f[0] + f[1] + f[2] + f[3]) % mod
            g[1] = (f[2] + f[3]) % mod
            g[2] = (f[1] + f[3]) % mod
            g[3] = f[0]
            f = g
        return f[0]
```

#### Java

```java
class Solution {
    public int numTilings(int n) {
        long[] f = {1, 0, 0, 0};
        int mod = (int) 1e9 + 7;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            long[] g = new long[4];
            g[0] = (f[0] + f[1] + f[2] + f[3]) % mod;
            g[1] = (f[2] + f[3]) % mod;
            g[2] = (f[1] + f[3]) % mod;
            g[3] = f[0];
            f = g;
        }
        return (int) f[0];
    }
}
```

#### C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    const int mod = 1e9 + 7;

    int numTilings(int n) {
        long f[4] = {1, 0, 0, 0};
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            long g[4] = {0, 0, 0, 0};
            g[0] = (f[0] + f[1] + f[2] + f[3]) % mod;
            g[1] = (f[2] + f[3]) % mod;
            g[2] = (f[1] + f[3]) % mod;
            g[3] = f[0];
            memcpy(f, g, sizeof(g));
        }
        return f[0];
    }
};
```

#### Go

```go
func numTilings(n int) int {
	f := [4]int{}
	f[0] = 1
	const mod int = 1e9 + 7
	for i := 1; i <= n; i++ {
		g := [4]int{}
		g[0] = (f[0] + f[1] + f[2] + f[3]) % mod
		g[1] = (f[2] + f[3]) % mod
		g[2] = (f[1] + f[3]) % mod
		g[3] = f[0]
		f = g
	}
	return f[0]
}
```
