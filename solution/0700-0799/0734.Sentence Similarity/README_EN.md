# [734. Sentence Similarity](https://leetcode.com/problems/sentence-similarity)

[中文文档](/solution/0700-0799/0734.Sentence%20Similarity/README.md)

## Description
<p>Given two sentences <code>words1, words2</code> (each represented as an array of strings), and a list of similar word pairs <code>pairs</code>, determine if two sentences are similar.</p>

<p>For example, "great acting skills" and "fine drama talent" are similar, if the similar word pairs are <code>pairs = [["great", "fine"], ["acting","drama"], ["skills","talent"]]</code>.</p>

<p>Note that the similarity relation is not transitive. For example, if "great" and "fine" are similar, and "fine" and "good" are similar, "great" and "good" are <b>not</b> necessarily similar.</p>

<p>However, similarity is symmetric. For example, "great" and "fine" being similar is the same as "fine" and "great" being similar.</p>

<p>Also, a word is always similar with itself. For example, the sentences <code>words1 = ["great"], words2 = ["great"], pairs = []</code> are similar, even though there are no specified similar word pairs.</p>

<p>Finally, sentences can only be similar if they have the same number of words. So a sentence like <code>words1 = ["great"]</code> can never be similar to <code>words2 = ["doubleplus","good"]</code>.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b></p>

<ul>
	<li>The length of <code>words1</code> and <code>words2</code> will not exceed <code>1000</code>.</li>
	<li>The length of <code>pairs</code> will not exceed <code>2000</code>.</li>
	<li>The length of each <code>pairs[i]</code> will be <code>2</code>.</li>
	<li>The length of each <code>words[i]</code> and <code>pairs[i][j]</code> will be in the range <code>[1, 20]</code>.</li>
</ul>
