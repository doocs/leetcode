# [791. Custom Sort String](https://leetcode.com/problems/custom-sort-string)

[中文文档](/solution/0700-0799/0791.Custom%20Sort%20String/README.md)

## Description

<p><code>S</code> and <code>T</code> are strings composed of lowercase letters. In <code>S</code>, no letter occurs more than once.</p>

<p><code>S</code> was sorted in some custom order previously. We want to permute the characters of <code>T</code> so that they match the order that <code>S</code> was sorted. More specifically, if <code>x</code> occurs before <code>y</code> in <code>S</code>, then <code>x</code> should occur before <code>y</code> in the returned string.</p>

<p>Return any permutation of <code>T</code> (as a string) that satisfies this property.</p>

<pre>

<strong>Example :</strong>

<strong>Input:</strong> 

S = &quot;cba&quot;

T = &quot;abcd&quot;

<strong>Output:</strong> &quot;cbad&quot;

<strong>Explanation:</strong> 

&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot; appear in S, so the order of &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot; should be &quot;c&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;a&quot;. 

Since &quot;d&quot; does not appear in S, it can be at any position in T. &quot;dcba&quot;, &quot;cdba&quot;, &quot;cbda&quot; are also valid outputs.

</pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>S</code> has length at most <code>26</code>, and no character is repeated in <code>S</code>.</li>
	<li><code>T</code> has length at most <code>200</code>.</li>
	<li><code>S</code> and <code>T</code> consist of lowercase letters only.</li>
</ul>
