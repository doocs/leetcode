# [482. License Key Formatting](https://leetcode.com/problems/license-key-formatting)

## Description
<p>You are given a license key represented as a string S which consists only alphanumeric character and dashes. The string is separated into N+1 groups by N dashes.</p>



<p>Given a number K, we would want to reformat the strings such that each group contains <i>exactly</i> K characters, except for the first group which could be shorter than K, but still must contain at least one character. Furthermore, there must be a dash inserted between two groups and all lowercase letters should be converted to uppercase.</p>



<p>Given a non-empty string S and a number K, format the string according to the rules described above.</p>



<p><b>Example 1:</b><br />

<pre>

<b>Input:</b> S = "5F3Z-2e-9-w", K = 4



<b>Output:</b> "5F3Z-2E9W"



<b>Explanation:</b> The string S has been split into two parts, each part has 4 characters.

Note that the two extra dashes are not needed and can be removed.

</pre>

</p>





<p><b>Example 2:</b><br />

<pre>

<b>Input:</b> S = "2-5g-3-J", K = 2



<b>Output:</b> "2-5G-3J"



<b>Explanation:</b> The string S has been split into three parts, each part has 2 characters except the first part as it could be shorter as mentioned above.

</pre>

</p>



<p><b>Note:</b><br>

<ol>

<li>The length of string S will not exceed 12,000, and K is a positive integer.</li>

<li>String S consists only of alphanumerical characters (a-z and/or A-Z and/or 0-9) and dashes(-).</li>

<li>String S is non-empty.</li>

</ol>
