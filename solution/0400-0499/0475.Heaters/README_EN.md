# [475. Heaters](https://leetcode.com/problems/heaters)

## Description
<p>Winter is coming! Your first job during the contest is to design a standard heater with fixed warm radius to warm all the houses.</p>



<p>Now, you are given positions of houses and heaters on a horizontal line, find out minimum radius of heaters so that all houses could be covered by those heaters.</p>



<p>So, your input will be the positions of houses and heaters seperately, and your expected output will be the minimum radius standard of heaters.</p>



<p><b>Note:</b></p>



<ol>

	<li>Numbers of houses and heaters you are given are non-negative and will not exceed 25000.</li>

	<li>Positions of houses and heaters you are given are non-negative and will not exceed 10^9.</li>

	<li>As long as a house is in the heaters&#39; warm radius range, it can be warmed.</li>

	<li>All the heaters follow your radius standard and the warm radius will the same.</li>

</ol>

<p><b>Example 1:</b></p>



<pre>

<b>Input:</b> [1,2,3],[2]

<b>Output:</b> 1

<b>Explanation:</b> The only heater was placed in the position 2, and if we use the radius 1 standard, then all the houses can be warmed.

</pre>

<p><b>Example 2:</b></p>



<pre>

<b>Input:</b> [1,2,3,4],[1,4]

<b>Output:</b> 1

<b>Explanation:</b> The two heater was placed in the position 1 and 4. We need to use radius 1 standard, then all the houses can be warmed.
