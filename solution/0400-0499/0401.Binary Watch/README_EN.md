# [401. Binary Watch](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-watch)

## Description
<p>A binary watch has 4 LEDs on the top which represent the <b>hours</b> (<b>0-11</b>), and the 6 LEDs on the bottom represent the <b>minutes</b> (<b>0-59</b>).</p>
<p>Each LED represents a zero or one, with the least significant bit on the right.</p>

<p>For example, the above binary watch reads "3:25".</p>

<p>Given a non-negative integer <i>n</i> which represents the number of LEDs that are currently on, return all possible times the watch could represent.</p>

<p><b>Example:</b>
<pre>Input: n = 1<br>Return: ["1:00", "2:00", "4:00", "8:00", "0:01", "0:02", "0:04", "0:08", "0:16", "0:32"]</pre>
</p>

<p><b>Note:</b><br />
<ul>
<li>The order of output does not matter.</li>
<li>The hour must not contain a leading zero, for example "01:00" is not valid, it should be "1:00".</li>
<li>The minute must be consist of two digits and may contain a leading zero, for example "10:2" is not valid, it should be "10:02".</li>
</ul>
