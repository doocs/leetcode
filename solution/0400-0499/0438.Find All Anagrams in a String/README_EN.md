# [438. Find All Anagrams in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string)

## Description
<p>Given a string <b>s</b> and a <b>non-empty</b> string <b>p</b>, find all the start indices of <b>p</b>'s anagrams in <b>s</b>.</p>



<p>Strings consists of lowercase English letters only and the length of both strings <b>s</b> and <b>p</b> will not be larger than 20,100.</p>



<p>The order of output does not matter.</p>



<p><b>Example 1:</b>

<pre>

<b>Input:</b>

s: "cbaebabacd" p: "abc"



<b>Output:</b>

[0, 6]



<b>Explanation:</b>

The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".

The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".

</pre>

</p>



<p><b>Example 2:</b>

<pre>

<b>Input:</b>

s: "abab" p: "ab"



<b>Output:</b>

[0, 1, 2]
