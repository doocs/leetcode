# [413. Arithmetic Slices](https://leetcode.com/problems/arithmetic-slices)

[中文文档](/solution/0400-0499/0413.Arithmetic%20Slices/README.md)

## Description
<p>A sequence of number is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.</p>



<p>For example, these are arithmetic sequence:</p>

<pre>1, 3, 5, 7, 9

7, 7, 7, 7

3, -1, -5, -9</pre>



<p>The following sequence is not arithmetic.</p> <pre>1, 1, 2, 5, 7</pre> 

<br/>



<p>A zero-indexed array A consisting of N numbers is given. A slice of that array is any pair of integers (P, Q) such that 0 <= P < Q < N.</p>



<p>A slice (P, Q) of array A is called arithmetic if the sequence:<br/>

    A[P], A[p + 1], ..., A[Q - 1], A[Q] is arithmetic. In particular, this means that P + 1 < Q.</p>



<p>The function should return the number of arithmetic slices in the array A. </p>

<br/>



<p><b>Example:</b>

<pre>

A = [1, 2, 3, 4]



return: 3, for 3 arithmetic slices in A: [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4] and [1, 2, 3, 4] itself.
