# [446. Arithmetic Slices II - Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/arithmetic-slices-ii-subsequence)

[中文文档](/solution/0400-0499/0446.Arithmetic%20Slices%20II%20-%20Subsequence/README.md)

## Description
<p>A sequence of numbers is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.</p>



<p>For example, these are arithmetic sequences:</p>



<pre>

1, 3, 5, 7, 9

7, 7, 7, 7

3, -1, -5, -9</pre>



<p>The following sequence is not arithmetic.</p>



<pre>

1, 1, 2, 5, 7</pre>

&nbsp;



<p>A zero-indexed array A consisting of N numbers is given. A <b>subsequence</b> slice of that array is any sequence of integers (P<sub>0</sub>, P<sub>1</sub>, ..., P<sub>k</sub>) such that 0 &le; P<sub>0</sub> &lt; P<sub>1</sub> &lt; ... &lt; P<sub>k</sub> &lt; N.</p>



<p>A <b>subsequence</b> slice (P<sub>0</sub>, P<sub>1</sub>, ..., P<sub>k</sub>) of array A is called arithmetic if the sequence A[P<sub>0</sub>], A[P<sub>1</sub>], ..., A[P<sub>k-1</sub>], A[P<sub>k</sub>] is arithmetic. In particular, this means that k &ge; 2.</p>



<p>The function should return the number of arithmetic subsequence slices in the array A.</p>



<p>The input contains N integers. Every integer is in the range of -2<sup>31</sup> and 2<sup>31</sup>-1 and 0 &le; N &le; 1000. The output is guaranteed to be less than 2<sup>31</sup>-1.</p>

&nbsp;



<p><b>Example:</b></p>



<pre>

<b>Input:</b> [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]



<b>Output:</b> 7



<b>Explanation:</b>

All arithmetic subsequence slices are:

[2,4,6]

[4,6,8]

[6,8,10]

[2,4,6,8]

[4,6,8,10]

[2,4,6,8,10]

[2,6,10]

</pre>
