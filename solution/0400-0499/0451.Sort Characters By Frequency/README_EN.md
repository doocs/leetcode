# [451. Sort Characters By Frequency](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-characters-by-frequency)

[中文文档](/solution/0400-0499/0451.Sort%20Characters%20By%20Frequency/README.md)

## Description

<p>Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.</p>

<p><b>Example 1:</b>

<pre>

<b>Input:</b>

"tree"



<b>Output:</b>

"eert"



<b>Explanation:</b>

'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.

So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.

</pre>

</p>

<p><b>Example 2:</b>

<pre>

<b>Input:</b>

"cccaaa"



<b>Output:</b>

"cccaaa"



<b>Explanation:</b>

Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.

Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.

</pre>

</p>

<p><b>Example 3:</b>

<pre>

<b>Input:</b>

"Aabb"



<b>Output:</b>

"bbAa"



<b>Explanation:</b>

"bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.

Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
