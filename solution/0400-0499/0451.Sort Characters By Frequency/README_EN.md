[中文文档](/solution/0400-0499/0451.Sort%20Characters%20By%20Frequency/README.md)

## Description

<p>Given a string <code>s</code>, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters, and return <em>the sorted string</em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> s = &quot;tree&quot;
<strong>Output:</strong> &quot;eert&quot;
<strong>Explanation:</strong> &#39;e&#39; appears twice while &#39;r&#39; and &#39;t&#39; both appear once.
So &#39;e&#39; must appear before both &#39;r&#39; and &#39;t&#39;. Therefore &quot;eetr&quot; is also a valid answer.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> s = &quot;cccaaa&quot;
<strong>Output:</strong> &quot;aaaccc&quot;
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Both &#39;c&#39; and &#39;a&#39; appear three times, so &quot;aaaccc&quot; is also a valid answer.
Note that &quot;cacaca&quot; is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> s = &quot;Aabb&quot;
<strong>Output:</strong> &quot;bbAa&quot;
<strong>Explanation:</strong> &quot;bbaA&quot; is also a valid answer, but &quot;Aabb&quot; is incorrect.
Note that &#39;A&#39; and &#39;a&#39; are treated as two different characters.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 5 * 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>s</code> consists of English letters and digits.</li>
</ul>
