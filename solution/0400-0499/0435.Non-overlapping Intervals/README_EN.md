# [435. Non-overlapping Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals)

[中文文档](/solution/0400-0499/0435.Non-overlapping%20Intervals/README.md)

## Description

<p>Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.</p>

<ol>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Example 1:</b></p>

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
<b>Output:</b> 1
<b>Explanation:</b> [1,3] can be removed and the rest of intervals are non-overlapping.
</pre>

<p><b>Example 2:</b></p>

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
<b>Output:</b> 2
<b>Explanation:</b> You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of intervals non-overlapping.
</pre>

<p><b>Example 3:</b></p>

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> [[1,2],[2,3]]
<b>Output:</b> 0
<b>Explanation:</b> You don&#39;t need to remove any of the intervals since they&#39;re already non-overlapping.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Note:</b></p>

<ol>
	<li>You may assume the interval&#39;s end point is always bigger than its start point.</li>
	<li>Intervals like [1,2] and [2,3] have borders &quot;touching&quot; but they don&#39;t overlap each other.</li>
</ol>
