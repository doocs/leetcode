# [492. Construct the Rectangle](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-the-rectangle)

## Description
<p>

For a web developer, it is very important to know how to design a web page's size. So, given a specific rectangular web page’s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:<pre>

1. The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.

<br>2. The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.

<br>3. The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.

</pre>

You need to output the length L and the width W of the web page you designed in sequence.

</p>





<p><b>Example:</b><br />

<pre>

<b>Input:</b> 4

<b>Output:</b> [2, 2]

<b>Explanation:</b> The target area is 4, and all the possible ways to construct it are [1,4], [2,2], [4,1]. 

But according to requirement 2, [1,4] is illegal; according to requirement 3,  [4,1] is not optimal compared to [2,2]. So the length L is 2, and the width W is 2.

</pre>

</p>



<p><b>Note:</b><br>

<ol>

<li>The given area won't exceed 10,000,000 and is a positive integer</li>

<li>The web page's width and length you designed must be positive integers.</li>

</ol>

</p>
