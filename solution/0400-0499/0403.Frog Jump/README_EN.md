# [403. Frog Jump](https://leetcode.com/problems/frog-jump)

[中文文档](/solution/0400-0499/0403.Frog%20Jump/README.md)

## Description

<p>A frog is crossing a river. The river is divided into some number of units, and at each unit, there may or may not exist a stone. The frog can jump on a stone, but it must not jump into the water.</p>

<p>Given a list of <code>stones</code>&#39; positions (in units) in sorted <strong>ascending order</strong>, determine if the frog can cross the river by landing on the last stone. Initially, the frog is on the first stone and assumes the first jump must be <code>1</code> unit.</p>

<p>If the frog&#39;s last jump was <code>k</code> units, its next jump must be either <code>k - 1</code>, <code>k</code>, or <code>k + 1</code> units. The frog can only jump in the forward direction.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> stones = [0,1,3,5,6,8,12,17]
<strong>Output:</strong> true
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The frog can jump to the last stone by jumping 1 unit to the 2nd stone, then 2 units to the 3rd stone, then 2 units to the 4th stone, then 3 units to the 6th stone, 4 units to the 7th stone, and 5 units to the 8th stone.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> stones = [0,1,2,3,4,8,9,11]
<strong>Output:</strong> false
<strong>Explanation:</strong> There is no way to jump to the last stone as the gap between the 5th and 6th stone is too large.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>2 &lt;= stones.length &lt;= 2000</code></li>
	<li><code>0 &lt;= stones[i] &lt;= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1</code></li>
	<li><code>stones[0] == 0</code></li>
	<li><code>stones</code>&nbsp;is sorted in a strictly increasing order.</li>
</ul>

## Solutions

DP, use `dp[i][k]` to indicate whether `i` can be reached when the last jump was `k` units, and define the base case as `dp[0][0] = True` (starting point is at index 0).

Because "the frog's last jump was `k` units, its next jump must be either `k - 1`, `k`, or `k + 1` units", so if any of `dp[j][k-1], dp[j][k], dp[j][k + 1]` is true, frog can jump from `j` to `i`.

### **Python3**

```python
class Solution:
    def canCross(self, stones: List[int]) -> bool:
        n = len(stones)
        dp = [[False] * n for i in range(n)]
        dp[0][0] = True
        for i in range(1, n):
            for j in range(i):
                k = stones[i] - stones[j]
                if k > j + 1:
                    continue
                dp[i][k] = dp[j][k - 1] or dp[j][k] or dp[j][k + 1]
                if i == n - 1 and dp[i][k]:
                    return True
        return False
```

### **Java**

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canCross(int[] stones) {
        int n = stones.length;
        boolean[][] dp = new boolean[n][n];
        dp[0][0] = true;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                int k = stones[i] - stones[j];
                if (k > j + 1) {
                    continue;
                }
                dp[i][k] = dp[j][k - 1] || dp[j][k] || dp[j][k + 1];
                if (i == n - 1 && dp[i][k]) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```
