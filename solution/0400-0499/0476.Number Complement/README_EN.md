# [476. Number Complement](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-complement)

## Description
<p>Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Example 1:</b></p>

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> 5
<b>Output:</b> 2
<b>Explanation:</b> The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Example 2:</b></p>

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> 1
<b>Output:</b> 0
<b>Explanation:</b> The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Note:</b></p>

<ol>
	<li>The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.</li>
	<li>You could assume no leading zero bit in the integer&rsquo;s binary representation.</li>
