# [406. Queue Reconstruction by Height](https://leetcode.com/problems/queue-reconstruction-by-height)

## Description
<p>Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue. Each person is described by a pair of integers <code>(h, k)</code>, where <code>h</code> is the height of the person and <code>k</code> is the number of people in front of this person who have a height greater than or equal to <code>h</code>. Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.</p>
