## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>Table: <code>EmployeeShifts</code></p>

<pre>
+------------------+---------+
| Column Name      | Type    |
+------------------+---------+
| employee_id      | int     |
| start_time       | time    |
| end_time         | time    |
+------------------+---------+
(employee_id, start_time) is the unique key for this table.
This table contains information about the shifts worked by employees, including the start and end times on a specific date.
</pre>

<p>Write a solution to count the number of <strong>overlapping shifts</strong> for each employee. Two shifts are considered overlapping if one shift&rsquo;s <code>end_time</code> is <strong>later than</strong> another shift&rsquo;s <code>start_time</code>.</p>

<p><em>Return the result table ordered by</em> <code>employee_id</code> <em>in <strong>ascending</strong> order</em>.</p>

<p>The query result format is in the following example.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Input:</strong></p>

<p><code>EmployeeShifts</code> table:</p>

</pre>

<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Employee 1 has 3 shifts:
	<ul>
		<li>08:00:00 to 12:00:00</li>
		<li>11:00:00 to 15:00:00</li>
		<li>14:00:00 to 18:00:00</li>
	</ul>
	The first shift overlaps with the second, and the second overlaps with the third, resulting in 2 overlapping shifts.</li>
	<li>Employee 2 has 2 shifts:
	<ul>
		<li>09:00:00 to 17:00:00</li>
		<li>16:00:00 to 20:00:00</li>
	</ul>
	These shifts overlap with each other, resulting in 1 overlapping shift.</li>
	<li>Employee 3 has 3 shifts:
	<ul>
		<li>10:00:00 to 12:00:00</li>
		<li>13:00:00 to 15:00:00</li>
		<li>16:00:00 to 18:00:00</li>
	</ul>
	None of these shifts overlap, so Employee 3 is not included in the output.</li>
	<li>Employee 4 has 2 shifts:
	<ul>
		<li>08:00:00 to 10:00:00</li>
		<li>09:00:00 to 11:00:00</li>
	</ul>
	These shifts overlap with each other, resulting in 1 overlapping shift.</li>
</ul>

<p>The output shows the employee_id and the count of overlapping shifts for each employee who has at least one overlapping shift, ordered by employee_id in ascending order.</p>

## Solutions

<!-- solution:start -->

### Solution 1: Self-Join + Group Counting

We first use a self-join to connect the `EmployeeShifts` table to itself. The join condition ensures that we only compare shifts belonging to the same employee and check if there is any overlap between shifts.

1. `t1.start_time < t2.start_time`: Ensures that the start time of the first shift is earlier than the start time of the second shift.
2. `t1.end_time > t2.start_time`: Ensures that the end time of the first shift is later than the start time of the second shift.

Next, we group the data by `employee_id` and count the number of overlapping shifts for each employee.

Finally, we filter out employees with overlapping shift counts greater than $0$ and sort the results in ascending order by `employee_id`.

#### MySQL

```sql
SELECT
    t1.employee_id,
    COUNT(*) AS overlapping_shifts
FROM
    EmployeeShifts t1
    JOIN EmployeeShifts t2
        ON t1.employee_id = t2.employee_id
        AND t1.start_time < t2.start_time
        AND t1.end_time > t2.start_time
GROUP BY 1
HAVING overlapping_shifts > 0
ORDER BY 1;
```

#### Pandas

```python
import pandas as pd


def find_overlapping_shifts(employee_shifts: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    merged_shifts = employee_shifts.merge(
        employee_shifts, on="employee_id", suffixes=("_t1", "_t2")
    )
    overlapping_shifts = merged_shifts[
        (merged_shifts["start_time_t1"] < merged_shifts["start_time_t2"])
        & (merged_shifts["end_time_t1"] > merged_shifts["start_time_t2"])
    ]
    result = (
        overlapping_shifts.groupby("employee_id")
        .size()
        .reset_index(name="overlapping_shifts")
    )
    result = result[result["overlapping_shifts"] > 0]
    result = result.sort_values("employee_id").reset_index(drop=True)
    return result
```
