# [1989. Maximum Number of People That Can Be Caught in Tag ðŸ”’](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-people-that-can-be-caught-in-tag)

[ä¸­æ–‡æ–‡æ¡£](/solution/1900-1999/1989.Maximum%20Number%20of%20People%20That%20Can%20Be%20Caught%20in%20Tag/README.md)

## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>You are playing a game of tag with your friends. In tag, people are divided into two teams: people who are &quot;it&quot;, and people who are not &quot;it&quot;. The people who are &quot;it&quot; want to catch as many people as possible who are not &quot;it&quot;.</p>

<p>You are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer array <code>team</code> containing only zeros (denoting people who are <strong>not</strong> &quot;it&quot;) and ones (denoting people who are &quot;it&quot;), and an integer <code>dist</code>. A person who is &quot;it&quot; at index <code>i</code> can catch any <strong>one</strong> person whose index is in the range <code>[i - dist, i + dist]</code> (<strong>inclusive</strong>) and is <strong>not</strong> &quot;it&quot;.</p>

<p>Return <em>the <strong>maximum</strong> number of people that the people who are &quot;it&quot; can catch</em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> team = [0,1,0,1,0], dist = 3
<strong>Output:</strong> 2
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
The person who is &quot;it&quot; at index 1 can catch people in the range [i-dist, i+dist] = [1-3, 1+3] = [-2, 4].
They can catch the person who is not &quot;it&quot; at index 2.
The person who is &quot;it&quot; at index 3 can catch people in the range [i-dist, i+dist] = [3-3, 3+3] = [0, 6].
They can catch the person who is not &quot;it&quot; at index 0.
The person who is not &quot;it&quot; at index 4 will not be caught because the people at indices 1 and 3 are already catching one person.</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> team = [1], dist = 1
<strong>Output:</strong> 0
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
There are no people who are not &quot;it&quot; to catch.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> team = [0], dist = 1
<strong>Output:</strong> 0
<strong>Explanation:
</strong>There are no people who are &quot;it&quot; to catch people.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= team.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>0 &lt;= team[i] &lt;= 1</code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= dist &lt;= team.length</code></li>
</ul>

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Two Pointers

We can use two pointers $i$ and $j$ to point to the ghost and non-ghost people, initially $i=0$, $j=0$.

Then we traverse the array from left to right. When we encounter a ghost, i.e., $team[i]=1$, if $j \lt n$ and $\textit{team}[j]=1$ or $i - j \gt \textit{dist}$, then move pointer $j$ to the right in a loop. This means we need to find the first non-ghost person such that the distance between $i$ and $j$ does not exceed $\textit{dist}$. If such a person is found, move pointer $j$ one step to the right, indicating that we have caught this person, and increment the answer by one. Continue traversing the array until the entire array is processed.

Finally, return the answer.

The time complexity is $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the array $\textit{team}$. The space complexity is $O(1)$.

#### Python3

```python
class Solution:
    def catchMaximumAmountofPeople(self, team: List[int], dist: int) -> int:
        ans = j = 0
        n = len(team)
        for i, x in enumerate(team):
            if x:
                while j < n and (team[j] or i - j > dist):
                    j += 1
                if j < n and abs(i - j) <= dist:
                    ans += 1
                    j += 1
        return ans
```

#### Java

```java
class Solution {
    public int catchMaximumAmountofPeople(int[] team, int dist) {
        int ans = 0;
        int n = team.length;
        for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (team[i] == 1) {
                while (j < n && (team[j] == 1 || i - j > dist)) {
                    ++j;
                }
                if (j < n && Math.abs(i - j) <= dist) {
                    ++ans;
                    ++j;
                }
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

#### C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int catchMaximumAmountofPeople(vector<int>& team, int dist) {
        int ans = 0;
        int n = team.size();
        for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (team[i]) {
                while (j < n && (team[j] || i - j > dist)) {
                    ++j;
                }
                if (j < n && abs(i - j) <= dist) {
                    ++ans;
                    ++j;
                }
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

#### Go

```go
func catchMaximumAmountofPeople(team []int, dist int) (ans int) {
	n := len(team)
	for i, j := 0, 0; i < n; i++ {
		if team[i] == 1 {
			for j < n && (team[j] == 1 || i-j > dist) {
				j++
			}
			if j < n && abs(i-j) <= dist {
				ans++
				j++
			}
		}
	}
	return
}

func abs(x int) int {
	if x < 0 {
		return -x
	}
	return x
}
```
