## Description

<p>Given a string <code>s</code>, find two <strong>disjoint palindromic subsequences</strong> of <code>s</code> such that the <strong>product</strong> of their lengths is <strong>maximized</strong>. The two subsequences are <strong>disjoint</strong> if they do not both pick a character at the same index.</p>

<p>Return <em>the <strong>maximum</strong> possible <strong>product</strong> of the lengths of the two palindromic subsequences</em>.</p>

<p>A <strong>subsequence</strong> is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters. A string is <strong>palindromic</strong> if it reads the same forward and backward.</p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> s = &quot;leetcodecom&quot;
<strong>Output:</strong> 9
<strong>Explanation</strong>: An optimal solution is to choose &quot;ete&quot; for the 1<sup>st</sup> subsequence and &quot;cdc&quot; for the 2<sup>nd</sup> subsequence.
The product of their lengths is: 3 * 3 = 9.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> s = &quot;bb&quot;
<strong>Output:</strong> 1
<strong>Explanation</strong>: An optimal solution is to choose &quot;b&quot; (the first character) for the 1<sup>st</sup> subsequence and &quot;b&quot; (the second character) for the 2<sup>nd</sup> subsequence.
The product of their lengths is: 1 * 1 = 1.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> s = &quot;accbcaxxcxx&quot;
<strong>Output:</strong> 25
<strong>Explanation</strong>: An optimal solution is to choose &quot;accca&quot; for the 1<sup>st</sup> subsequence and &quot;xxcxx&quot; for the 2<sup>nd</sup> subsequence.
The product of their lengths is: 5 * 5 = 25.
</pre>

<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>2 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 12</code></li>
	<li><code>s</code> consists of lowercase English letters only.</li>
</ul>
