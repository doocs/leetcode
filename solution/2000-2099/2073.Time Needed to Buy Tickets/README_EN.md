# [2073. Time Needed to Buy Tickets](https://leetcode.com/problems/time-needed-to-buy-tickets)

[中文文档](/solution/2000-2099/2073.Time%20Needed%20to%20Buy%20Tickets/README.md)

## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>There are <code>n</code> people in a line queuing to buy tickets, where the <code>0<sup>th</sup></code> person is at the <strong>front</strong> of the line and the <code>(n - 1)<sup>th</sup></code> person is at the <strong>back</strong> of the line.</p>

<p>You are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer array <code>tickets</code> of length <code>n</code> where the number of tickets that the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> person would like to buy is <code>tickets[i]</code>.</p>

<p>Each person takes <strong>exactly 1 second</strong> to buy a ticket. A person can only buy <strong>1 ticket at a time</strong> and has to go back to <strong>the end</strong> of the line (which happens <strong>instantaneously</strong>) in order to buy more tickets. If a person does not have any tickets left to buy, the person will <strong>leave </strong>the line.</p>

<p>Return <em>the <strong>time taken</strong> for the person at position </em><code>k</code><em>&nbsp;</em><strong><em>(0-indexed)</em>&nbsp;</strong><em>to finish buying tickets</em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> tickets = [2,3,2], k = 2
<strong>Output:</strong> 6
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
- In the first pass, everyone in the line buys a ticket and the line becomes [1, 2, 1].
- In the second pass, everyone in the line buys a ticket and the line becomes [0, 1, 0].
The person at&nbsp;position 2 has successfully bought 2 tickets and it took 3 + 3 = 6 seconds.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> tickets = [5,1,1,1], k = 0
<strong>Output:</strong> 8
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
- In the first pass, everyone in the line buys a ticket and the line becomes [4, 0, 0, 0].
- In the next 4 passes, only the person in position 0 is buying tickets.
The person at&nbsp;position 0 has successfully bought 5 tickets and it took 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8 seconds.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>n == tickets.length</code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= n &lt;= 100</code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= tickets[i] &lt;= 100</code></li>
	<li><code>0 &lt;= k &lt; n</code></li>
</ul>

## Solutions

<!-- solution:start -->

### Solution 1: Single Pass

According to the problem description, when the $k^{th}$ person finishes buying tickets, all the people in front of the $k^{th}$ person will not buy more tickets than the $k^{th}$ person, and all the people behind the $k^{th}$ person will not buy more tickets than the $k^{th}$ person minus $1$.

Therefore, we can traverse the entire queue. For the $i^{th}$ person, if $i \leq k$, the time to buy tickets is $\min(\textit{tickets}[i], \textit{tickets}[k])$; otherwise, the time to buy tickets is $\min(\textit{tickets}[i], \textit{tickets}[k] - 1)$. We sum the buying time for all people to get the result.

The time complexity is $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the queue. The space complexity is $O(1)$.

#### Python3

```python
class Solution:
    def timeRequiredToBuy(self, tickets: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        ans = 0
        for i, x in enumerate(tickets):
            ans += min(x, tickets[k] if i <= k else tickets[k] - 1)
        return ans
```

#### Java

```java
class Solution {
    public int timeRequiredToBuy(int[] tickets, int k) {
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < tickets.length; ++i) {
            ans += Math.min(tickets[i], i <= k ? tickets[k] : tickets[k] - 1);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

#### C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int timeRequiredToBuy(vector<int>& tickets, int k) {
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < tickets.size(); ++i) {
            ans += min(tickets[i], i <= k ? tickets[k] : tickets[k] - 1);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

#### Go

```go
func timeRequiredToBuy(tickets []int, k int) (ans int) {
	for i, x := range tickets {
		t := tickets[k]
		if i > k {
			t--
		}
		ans += min(x, t)
	}
	return
}
```

#### TypeScript

```ts
function timeRequiredToBuy(tickets: number[], k: number): number {
    let ans = 0;
    const n = tickets.length;
    for (let i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        ans += Math.min(tickets[i], i <= k ? tickets[k] : tickets[k] - 1);
    }
    return ans;
}
```
