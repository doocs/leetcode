# [2037. Minimum Number of Moves to Seat Everyone](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-moves-to-seat-everyone)

[中文文档](/solution/2000-2099/2037.Minimum%20Number%20of%20Moves%20to%20Seat%20Everyone/README.md)

## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>There are <code>n</code> <strong>availabe </strong>seats and <code>n</code> students <strong>standing</strong> in a room. You are given an array <code>seats</code> of length <code>n</code>, where <code>seats[i]</code> is the position of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> seat. You are also given the array <code>students</code> of length <code>n</code>, where <code>students[j]</code> is the position of the <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> student.</p>

<p>You may perform the following move any number of times:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Increase or decrease the position of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> student by <code>1</code> (i.e., moving the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> student from position&nbsp;<code>x</code>&nbsp;to <code>x + 1</code> or <code>x - 1</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Return <em>the <strong>minimum number of moves</strong> required to move each student to a seat</em><em> such that no two students are in the same seat.</em></p>

<p>Note that there may be <strong>multiple</strong> seats or students in the <strong>same </strong>position at the beginning.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> seats = [3,1,5], students = [2,7,4]
<strong>Output:</strong> 4
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The students are moved as follows:
- The first student is moved from position 2 to position 1 using 1 move.
- The second student is moved from position 7 to position 5 using 2 moves.
- The third student is moved from position 4 to position 3 using 1 move.
In total, 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 moves were used.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> seats = [4,1,5,9], students = [1,3,2,6]
<strong>Output:</strong> 7
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The students are moved as follows:
- The first student is not moved.
- The second student is moved from position 3 to position 4 using 1 move.
- The third student is moved from position 2 to position 5 using 3 moves.
- The fourth student is moved from position 6 to position 9 using 3 moves.
In total, 0 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 7 moves were used.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> seats = [2,2,6,6], students = [1,3,2,6]
<strong>Output:</strong> 4
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Note that there are two seats at position 2 and two seats at position 6.
The students are moved as follows:
- The first student is moved from position 1 to position 2 using 1 move.
- The second student is moved from position 3 to position 6 using 3 moves.
- The third student is not moved.
- The fourth student is not moved.
In total, 1 + 3 + 0 + 0 = 4 moves were used.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>n == seats.length == students.length</code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= n &lt;= 100</code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= seats[i], students[j] &lt;= 100</code></li>
</ul>

## Solutions

<!-- solution:start -->

### Solution 1: Sorting

Sort both arrays, then traverse the two arrays, calculate the distance between each student's seat and their actual seat, and add all the distances to get the answer.

The time complexity is $O(n \times \log n)$, and the space complexity is $O(\log n)$. Here, $n$ is the length of the arrays `seats` and `students`.

#### Python3

```python
class Solution:
    def minMovesToSeat(self, seats: List[int], students: List[int]) -> int:
        seats.sort()
        students.sort()
        return sum(abs(a - b) for a, b in zip(seats, students))
```

#### Java

```java
class Solution {
    public int minMovesToSeat(int[] seats, int[] students) {
        Arrays.sort(seats);
        Arrays.sort(students);
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < seats.length; ++i) {
            ans += Math.abs(seats[i] - students[i]);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

#### C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minMovesToSeat(vector<int>& seats, vector<int>& students) {
        sort(seats.begin(), seats.end());
        sort(students.begin(), students.end());
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < seats.size(); ++i) {
            ans += abs(seats[i] - students[i]);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

#### Go

```go
func minMovesToSeat(seats []int, students []int) (ans int) {
	sort.Ints(seats)
	sort.Ints(students)
	for i, a := range seats {
		b := students[i]
		ans += abs(a - b)
	}
	return
}

func abs(x int) int {
	if x < 0 {
		return -x
	}
	return x
}
```

#### TypeScript

```ts
function minMovesToSeat(seats: number[], students: number[]): number {
    seats.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    students.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    return seats.reduce((acc, seat, i) => acc + Math.abs(seat - students[i]), 0);
}
```

#### Rust

```rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn min_moves_to_seat(mut seats: Vec<i32>, mut students: Vec<i32>) -> i32 {
        seats.sort();
        students.sort();
        let n = seats.len();
        let mut ans = 0;
        for i in 0..n {
            ans += (seats[i] - students[i]).abs();
        }
        ans
    }
}
```

#### C

```c
int cmp(const void* a, const void* b) {
    return *(int*) a - *(int*) b;
}

int minMovesToSeat(int* seats, int seatsSize, int* students, int studentsSize) {
    qsort(seats, seatsSize, sizeof(int), cmp);
    qsort(students, studentsSize, sizeof(int), cmp);
    int ans = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < seatsSize; i++) {
        ans += abs(seats[i] - students[i]);
    }
    return ans;
}
```
