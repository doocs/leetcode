match_id is the primary key of this table.
Each row is a record of a match, first_player and second_player contain the player_id of each match.
first_score and second_score contain the number of points of the first_player and second_player respectively.
You may assume that, in each match, players belong to the same group.
</pre>

<p>The winner in each group is the player who scored the maximum total points within the group. In the case of a tie, the <strong>lowest</strong> <code>player_id</code> wins.</p>

<p>Write an SQL query to find the winner in each group.</p>

<p>Return the result table in <strong>any order</strong>.</p>
