[中文文档](/solution/1100-1199/1194.Tournament%20Winners/README.md)

## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>Table: <code>Players</code></p>

<pre>
+-------------+-------+
| Column Name | Type  |
+-------------+-------+
| player_id   | int   |
| group_id    | int   |
+-------------+-------+
player_id is the primary key (column with unique values) of this table.
Each row of this table indicates the group of each player.
</pre>

<p>Table: <code>Matches</code></p>

<pre>
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| match_id      | int     |
| first_player  | int     |
| second_player | int     | 
| first_score   | int     |
| second_score  | int     |
+---------------+---------+
match_id is the primary key (column with unique values) of this table.
Each row is a record of a match, first_player and second_player contain the player_id of each match.
first_score and second_score contain the number of points of the first_player and second_player respectively.
You may assume that, in each match, players belong to the same group.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The winner in each group is the player who scored the maximum total points within the group. In the case of a tie, the <strong>lowest</strong> <code>player_id</code> wins.</p>

<p>Write a solution to find the winner in each group.</p>

<p>Return the result table in <strong>any order</strong>.</p>

<p>The result format is in the following example.</p>

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
WITH
    s AS (
        SELECT first_player AS player_id, first_score AS score, group_id
        FROM
            Matches AS m
            JOIN Players AS p ON m.first_player = p.player_id
        UNION ALL
        SELECT second_player AS player_id, second_score AS score, group_id
        FROM
            Matches AS m
            JOIN Players AS p ON m.second_player = p.player_id
    ),
    t AS (
        SELECT group_id, player_id, SUM(score) AS scores
        FROM s
        GROUP BY player_id
    ),
    p AS (
        SELECT
            group_id,
            player_id,
            RANK() OVER (
                PARTITION BY group_id
                ORDER BY scores DESC, player_id
            ) AS rk
        FROM t
    )
SELECT group_id, player_id
FROM p
WHERE rk = 1;
