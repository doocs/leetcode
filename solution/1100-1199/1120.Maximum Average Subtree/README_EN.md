# [1120. Maximum Average Subtree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-average-subtree)

[中文文档](/solution/1100-1199/1120.Maximum%20Average%20Subtree/README.md)

## Description

<p>Given the <code>root</code> of a binary tree, find the maximum average value of any subtree of that tree.</p>

<p>(A subtree of a tree is any node of that tree plus all its descendants. The average value of a tree is the sum of its values, divided by the number of nodes.)</p>

<pre>
<strong>Input: </strong><span id="example-input-1-1">[5,6,1]</span>
<strong>Output: </strong><span id="example-output-1">6.00000</span>
<strong>Explanation: </strong>
For the node with value = 5 we have an average of (5 + 6 + 1) / 3 = 4.
For the node with value = 6 we have an average of 6 / 1 = 6.
For the node with value = 1 we have an average of 1 / 1 = 1.
So the answer is 6 which is the maximum.

<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>The number of nodes in the tree is between <code>1</code> and <code>5000</code>.</li>
	<li>Each node will have a value between <code>0</code> and <code>100000</code>.</li>
	<li>Answers will be accepted as correct if they are within <code>10^-5</code> of the correct answer.</li>
</ol>
