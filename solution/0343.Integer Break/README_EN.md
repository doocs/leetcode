# Integer Break

Given a positive integer n, break it into the sum of **at least** two positive integers and maximize the product of those integers. Return the maximum product you can get.

## Example 1:
```
 Input: 2
 Output: 1
 Explanation: 2 = 1 + 1, 1 × 1 = 1.
```

## Example 2:
```
 Input: 10
  Output: 36
  Explanation: 10 = 3 + 3 + 4, 3 × 3 × 4 = 36.
```
Note: You may assume that n is not less than 2 and not larger than 58.
