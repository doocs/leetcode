# [2151. Maximum Good People Based on Statements](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-good-people-based-on-statements)

[中文文档](/solution/2100-2199/2151.Maximum%20Good%20People%20Based%20on%20Statements/README.md)

## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>There are two types of persons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The <strong>good person</strong>: The person who always tells the truth.</li>
	<li>The <strong>bad person</strong>: The person who might tell the truth and might lie.</li>
</ul>

<p>You are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> 2D integer array <code>statements</code> of size <code>n x n</code> that represents the statements made by <code>n</code> people about each other. More specifically, <code>statements[i][j]</code> could be one of the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>0</code> which represents a statement made by person <code>i</code> that person <code>j</code> is a <strong>bad</strong> person.</li>
	<li><code>1</code> which represents a statement made by person <code>i</code> that person <code>j</code> is a <strong>good</strong> person.</li>
	<li><code>2</code> represents that <strong>no statement</strong> is made by person <code>i</code> about person <code>j</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, no person ever makes a statement about themselves. Formally, we have that <code>statements[i][i] = 2</code> for all <code>0 &lt;= i &lt; n</code>.</p>

<p>Return <em>the <strong>maximum</strong> number of people who can be <strong>good</strong> based on the statements made by the </em><code>n</code><em> people</em>.</p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> statements = [[2,1,2],[1,2,2],[2,0,2]]
<strong>Output:</strong> 2
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Each person makes a single statement.
- Person 0 states that person 1 is good.
- Person 1 states that person 0 is good.
- Person 2 states that person 1 is bad.
Let&#39;s take person 2 as the key.
- Assuming that person 2 is a good person:
    - Based on the statement made by person 2, person 1 is a bad person.
    - Now we know for sure that person 1 is bad and person 2 is good.
    - Based on the statement made by person 1, and since person 1 is bad, they could be:
        - telling the truth. There will be a contradiction in this case and this assumption is invalid.
        - lying. In this case, person 0 is also a bad person and lied in their statement.
    - <strong>Following that person 2 is a good person, there will be only one good person in the group</strong>.
- Assuming that person 2 is a bad person:
    - Based on the statement made by person 2, and since person 2 is bad, they could be:
        - telling the truth. Following this scenario, person 0 and 1 are both bad as explained before.
            - <strong>Following that person 2 is bad but told the truth, there will be no good persons in the group</strong>.
        - lying. In this case person 1 is a good person.
            - Since person 1 is a good person, person 0 is also a good person.
            - <strong>Following that person 2 is bad and lied, there will be two good persons in the group</strong>.
We can see that at most 2 persons are good in the best case, so we return 2.
Note that there is more than one way to arrive at this conclusion.

<strong>Explanation:</strong> Each person makes a single statement.

Let&#39;s take person 0 as the key.
- Assuming that person 0 is a good person:
    - Based on the statement made by person 0, person 1 is a bad person and was lying.
    - <strong>Following that person 0 is a good person, there will be only one good person in the group</strong>.
- Assuming that person 0 is a bad person:
    - Based on the statement made by person 0, and since person 0 is bad, they could be:

### Solution 1

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### Python3

```python
class Solution:
    def maximumGood(self, statements: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        def check(mask: int) -> int:
            cnt = 0
            for i, row in enumerate(statements):
                if mask >> i & 1:
                    for j, x in enumerate(row):
                        if x < 2 and (mask >> j & 1) != x:
                            return 0
                    cnt += 1
            return cnt

        return max(check(i) for i in range(1, 1 << len(statements)))
```

#### Java

```java
class Solution {
    public int maximumGood(int[][] statements) {
        int ans = 0;
        for (int mask = 1; mask < 1 << statements.length; ++mask) {
            ans = Math.max(ans, check(mask, statements));
        }
        return ans;
    }

    private int check(int mask, int[][] statements) {
        int cnt = 0;
        int n = statements.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (((mask >> i) & 1) == 1) {
                for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                    int v = statements[i][j];
