[中文文档](/solution/0600-0699/0605.Can%20Place%20Flowers/README.md)

## Description

<p>Suppose you have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots - they would compete for water and both would die.</p>

<p>Given a flowerbed (represented as an array containing 0 and 1, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty), and a number <b>n</b>, return if <b>n</b> new flowers can be planted in it without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.</p>

<p><b>Example 1:</b><br />

<pre>

<b>Input:</b> flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1

<b>Output:</b> True

</pre>

</p>

<p><b>Example 2:</b><br />

<pre>

<b>Input:</b> flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2

<b>Output:</b> False

</pre>

</p>

<p><b>Note:</b><br>

<ol>

<li>The input array won't violate no-adjacent-flowers rule.</li>

<li>The input array size is in the range of [1, 20000].</li>

<li><b>n</b> is a non-negative integer which won't exceed the input array size.</li>

</ol>
