[中文文档](/solution/0600-0699/0691.Stickers%20to%20Spell%20Word/README.md)

## Description

<p>

We are given N different types of stickers. Each sticker has a lowercase English word on it.

</p><p>

You would like to spell out the given <code>target</code> string by cutting individual letters from your collection of stickers and rearranging them.

</p><p>

You can use each sticker more than once if you want, and you have infinite quantities of each sticker.

</p><p>

What is the minimum number of stickers that you need to spell out the <code>target</code>? If the task is impossible, return -1.

</p>

<p><b>Example 1:</b></p>

<p>Input:<pre>

["with", "example", "science"], "thehat"

</pre></p>

<p>Output:<pre>

3

</pre></p>

<p>Explanation:<pre>

We can use 2 "with" stickers, and 1 "example" sticker.

After cutting and rearrange the letters of those stickers, we can form the target "thehat".

Also, this is the minimum number of stickers necessary to form the target string.

</pre></p>

<p><b>Example 2:</b></p>

<p>Input:<pre>

["notice", "possible"], "basicbasic"

</pre></p>

<p>Output:<pre>

-1

</pre></p>

<p>Explanation:<pre>

We can't form the target "basicbasic" from cutting letters from the given stickers.

</pre></p>

<p><b>Note:</b>

<li><code>stickers</code> has length in the range <code>[1, 50]</code>.</li>

<li><code>stickers</code> consists of lowercase English words (without apostrophes).</li>

<li><code>target</code> has length in the range <code>[1, 15]</code>, and consists of lowercase English letters.</li>

<li>In all test cases, all words were chosen <u>randomly</u> from the 1000 most common US English words, and the target was chosen as a concatenation of two random words.</li>

<li>The time limit may be more challenging than usual.  It is expected that a 50 sticker test case can be solved within 35ms on average.</li>
