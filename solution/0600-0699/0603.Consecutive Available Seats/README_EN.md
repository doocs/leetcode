[中文文档](/solution/0600-0699/0603.Consecutive%20Available%20Seats/README.md)

## Description

Several friends at a cinema ticket office would like to reserve consecutive available seats.<br />

Can you help to query all the consecutive available seats order by the seat_id using the following <code>cinema</code> table?

<pre>

| seat_id | free |

|---------|------|

| 1       | 1    |

| 2       | 0    |

| 3       | 1    |

| 4       | 1    |

| 5       | 1    |

</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Your query should return the following result for the sample case above.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<pre>

| seat_id |

|---------|

| 3       |

| 4       |

| 5       |

</pre>

<b>Note</b>:

<ul>
	<li>The seat_id is an auto increment int, and free is bool (&#39;1&#39; means free, and &#39;0&#39; means occupied.).</li>
	<li>Consecutive available seats are more than 2(inclusive) seats consecutively available.</li>
</ul>
