# [686. Repeated String Match](https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-string-match)

## Description
<p>Given two strings A and B, find the minimum number of times A has to be repeated such that B is a substring of it. If no such solution, return -1.</p>



<p>For example, with A = &quot;abcd&quot; and B = &quot;cdabcdab&quot;.</p>



<p>Return 3, because by repeating A three times (&ldquo;abcdabcdabcd&rdquo;), B is a substring of it; and B is not a substring of A repeated two times (&quot;abcdabcd&quot;).</p>



<p><b>Note:</b><br />

The length of <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> will be between 1 and 10000.</p>
