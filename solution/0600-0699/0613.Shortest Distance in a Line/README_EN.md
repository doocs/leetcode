# [613. Shortest Distance in a Line](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-distance-in-a-line)

[中文文档](/solution/0600-0699/0613.Shortest%20Distance%20in%20a%20Line/README.md)

## Description

Table <code>point</code> holds the x coordinate of some points on x-axis in a plane, which are all integers.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Write a query to find the shortest distance between two points in these points.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<pre>

| x   |

|-----|

| -1  |

| 0   |

| 2   |

</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

The shortest distance is &#39;1&#39; obviously, which is from point &#39;-1&#39; to &#39;0&#39;. So the output is as below:

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<pre>

| shortest|

|---------|

| 1       |

</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<b>Note:</b> Every point is unique, which means there is no duplicates in table <code>point</code>.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<b>Follow-up:</b> What if all these points have an id and are arranged from the left most to the right most of x axis?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
