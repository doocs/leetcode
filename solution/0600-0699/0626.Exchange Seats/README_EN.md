[中文文档](/solution/0600-0699/0626.Exchange%20Seats/README.md)

## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>Table: <code>Seat</code></p>

<pre>
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| student     | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key (unique value) column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name and the ID of a student.
The ID sequence always starts from 1 and increments continuously.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Write a solution to swap the seat id of every two consecutive students. If the number of students is odd, the id of the last student is not swapped.</p>

<p>Return the result table ordered by <code>id</code> <strong>in ascending order</strong>.</p>

<p>The result format is in the following example.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> 
Seat table:

+----+---------+
| 1  | Doris   |
| 2  | Abbot   |
| 3  | Green   |
| 4  | Emerson |
| 5  | Jeames  |
