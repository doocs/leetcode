# [676. Implement Magic Dictionary](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-magic-dictionary)

[中文文档](/solution/0600-0699/0676.Implement%20Magic%20Dictionary/README.md)

## Description

<p>

Implement a magic directory with <code>buildDict</code>, and <code>search</code> methods.

</p>

<p>

For the method <code>buildDict</code>, you'll be given a list of non-repetitive words to build a dictionary.

</p>

<p>

For the method <code>search</code>, you'll be given a word, and judge whether if you modify <b>exactly</b> one character into <b>another</b> character in this word, the modified word is in the dictionary you just built.

</p>

<p><b>Example 1:</b><br />

<pre>

Input: buildDict(["hello", "leetcode"]), Output: Null

Input: search("hello"), Output: False

Input: search("hhllo"), Output: True

Input: search("hell"), Output: False

Input: search("leetcoded"), Output: False

</pre>

</p>

<p><b>Note:</b><br>

<ol>

<li>You may assume that all the inputs are consist of lowercase letters <code>a-z</code>.</li>

<li>For contest purpose, the test data is rather small by now. You could think about highly efficient algorithm after the contest.</li>

<li>Please remember to <b>RESET</b> your class variables declared in class MagicDictionary, as static/class variables are <b>persisted across multiple test cases</b>. Please see <a href="https://leetcode.com/faq/#different-output">here</a> for more details.</li>
