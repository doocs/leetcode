# Happy Number

Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

## Example :
```
  Input: 19
  Output: true
  Explanation: 
    1² + 9² = 82
    8² + 2² = 68
    6² + 8² = 100
    1² + 0² + 0² = 1
