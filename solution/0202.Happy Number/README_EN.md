# [202. Happy Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number)

## Description
<p>Write an algorithm to determine if a number is &quot;happy&quot;.</p>

<p>A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.</p>

<p><strong>Example:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<pre>
