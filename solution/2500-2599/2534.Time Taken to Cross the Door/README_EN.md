[ä¸­æ–‡æ–‡æ¡£](/solution/2500-2599/2534.Time%20Taken%20to%20Cross%20the%20Door/README.md)

## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>There are <code>n</code> persons numbered from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code> and a door. Each person can enter or exit through the door once, taking one second.</p>

<p>You are given a <strong>non-decreasing</strong> integer array <code>arrival</code> of size <code>n</code>, where <code>arrival[i]</code> is the arrival time of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> person at the door. You are also given an array <code>state</code> of size <code>n</code>, where <code>state[i]</code> is <code>0</code> if person <code>i</code> wants to enter through the door or <code>1</code> if they want to exit through the door.</p>

<p>If two or more persons want to use the door at the <strong>same</strong> time, they follow the following rules:</p>

<ul>
	<li>If the door was <strong>not</strong> used in the previous second, then the person who wants to <strong>exit</strong> goes first.</li>
	<li>If the door was used in the previous second for <strong>entering</strong>, the person who wants to enter goes first.</li>
	<li>If the door was used in the previous second for <strong>exiting</strong>, the person who wants to <strong>exit</strong> goes first.</li>
	<li>If multiple persons want to go in the same direction, the person with the <strong>smallest</strong> index goes first.</li>
</ul>

<p>Return <em>an array </em><code>answer</code><em> of size </em><code>n</code><em> where </em><code>answer[i]</code><em> is the second at which the </em><code>i<sup>th</sup></code><em> person crosses the door</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> that:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Only one person can cross the door at each second.</li>
	<li>A person may arrive at the door and wait without entering or exiting to follow the mentioned rules.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> arrival = [0,1,1,2,4], state = [0,1,0,0,1]
<strong>Output:</strong> [0,3,1,2,4]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> At each second we have the following:
- At t = 0: Person 0 is the only one who wants to enter, so they just enter through the door.
- At t = 1: Person 1 wants to exit, and person 2 wants to enter. Since the door was used the previous second for entering, person 2 enters.
- At t = 2: Person 1 still wants to exit, and person 3 wants to enter. Since the door was used the previous second for entering, person 3 enters.
- At t = 3: Person 1 is the only one who wants to exit, so they just exit through the door.
- At t = 4: Person 4 is the only one who wants to exit, so they just exit through the door.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> arrival = [0,0,0], state = [1,0,1]
<strong>Output:</strong> [0,2,1]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> At each second we have the following:
- At t = 0: Person 1 wants to enter while persons 0 and 2 want to exit. Since the door was not used in the previous second, the persons who want to exit get to go first. Since person 0 has a smaller index, they exit first.
- At t = 1: Person 1 wants to enter, and person 2 wants to exit. Since the door was used in the previous second for exiting, person 2 exits.
- At t = 2: Person 1 is the only one who wants to enter, so they just enter through the door.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>n == arrival.length == state.length</code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= n &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>0 &lt;= arrival[i] &lt;= n</code></li>
	<li><code>arrival</code> is sorted in <strong>non-decreasing</strong> order.</li>
	<li><code>state[i]</code> is either <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>.</li>
</ul>

## Solutions

<!-- solution:start -->

### Solution 1: Queue + Simulation

We define two queues, where $q[0]$ stores the indices of people who want to enter, and $q[1]$ stores the indices of people who want to exit.

We maintain a variable $t$ to represent the current time, and a variable $st$ to represent the current state of the door. When $st = 1$, it means the door is not in use or someone exited in the previous second. When $st = 0$, it means someone entered in the previous second. Initially, $t = 0$ and $st = 1$.

We traverse the array $\textit{arrival}$. For each person, if the current time $t$ is less than or equal to the time the person arrives at the door $\textit{arrival}[i]$, we add the person's index to the corresponding queue $q[\text{state}[i]]$.

Then we check if both queues $q[0]$ and $q[1]$ are not empty. If both are not empty, we dequeue the front element from the queue $q[st]$ and assign the current time $t$ to the person's passing time. If only one queue is not empty, we update the value of $st$ based on which queue is not empty, then dequeue the front element from that queue and assign the current time $t$ to the person's passing time. If both queues are empty, we update the value of $st$ to $1$, indicating the door is not in use.

Next, we increment the time $t$ by $1$ and continue traversing the array $\textit{arrival}$ until all people have passed through the door.

The time complexity is $O(n)$, and the space complexity is $O(n)$. Here, $n$ represents the length of the array $\textit{arrival}$.
