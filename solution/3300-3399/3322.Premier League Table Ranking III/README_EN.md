<p>Table: <code>SeasonStats</code></p>

<pre>
+------------------+---------+
| Column Name      | Type    |
+------------------+---------+
| season_id        | int     |
| team_id          | int     |
| team_name        | varchar |
| matches_played   | int     |
| wins             | int     |
| draws            | int     |
| losses           | int     |
| goals_for        | int     |
| goals_against    | int     |
+------------------+---------+
(season_id, team_id) is the unique key for this table.
This table contains season id, team id, team name, matches played, wins, draws, losses, goals scored (goals_for), and goals conceded (goals_against) for each team in each season.
</pre>

<p>Write a solution to calculate the <strong>points</strong>, <strong>goal difference</strong>, and <strong>rank</strong> for <strong>each team</strong> in <strong>each season</strong>. The ranking should be determined as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Teams are first ranked by their total points (highest to lowest)</li>
	<li>If points are tied, teams are then ranked by their goal difference (highest to lowest)</li>
	<li>If goal difference is also tied, teams are then ranked alphabetically by team name</li>
</ul>

<p>Points are calculated as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>3</code> points for a <strong>win</strong></li>
	<li><code>1</code> point for a <strong>draw</strong></li>
	<li><code>0</code> points for a <strong>loss</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Goal difference is calculated as: <code>goals_for - goals_against</code></p>

<p>Return <em>the result table ordered&nbsp;by</em> <code>season_id</code> <em>in <strong>ascending</strong> order, then by</em> <code>rank</code> <em>in <strong>ascending</strong> order, and finally by</em> <code>team_name</code> <em>in <strong>ascending</strong> order.</em></p>

<p>The query result format is in the following example.</p>

## Solutions

<!-- solution:start -->

### Solution 1: Window Function

We can use the window function `RANK()` to rank the teams by grouping them by season and sorting based on points, goal difference, and team name.

Finally, we just need to sort by `season_id`, `position`, and `team_name`.

#### MySQL

```sql
SELECT
    season_id,
    team_id,
    team_name,
    wins * 3 + draws points,
    goals_for - goals_against goal_difference,
    RANK() OVER (
        PARTITION BY season_id
        ORDER BY wins * 3 + draws DESC, goals_for - goals_against DESC, team_name
    ) position
FROM SeasonStats
ORDER BY 1, 6, 3;
```

#### Pandas

```python
import pandas as pd


def process_team_standings(season_stats: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    season_stats["points"] = season_stats["wins"] * 3 + season_stats["draws"]
    season_stats["goal_difference"] = (
        season_stats["goals_for"] - season_stats["goals_against"]
    )

    season_stats = season_stats.sort_values(
        ["season_id", "points", "goal_difference", "team_name"],
        ascending=[True, False, False, True],
    )

    season_stats["position"] = season_stats.groupby("season_id").cumcount() + 1

    return season_stats[
        ["season_id", "team_id", "team_name", "points", "goal_difference", "position"]
    ]
```
