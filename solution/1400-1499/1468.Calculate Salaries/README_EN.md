| 1          | 2           | Pronub        | 10863  |
| 1          | 3           | Tyrrox        | 5508   |
| 2          | 1           | Pam           | 300    |
| 2          | 7           | Bassem        | 450    |
| 2          | 9           | Hermione      | 700    |
| 3          | 7           | Bocaben       | 76     |
| 3          | 2           | Ognjen        | 1672   |
| 3          | 13          | Nyancat       | 2508   |
| 3          | 15          | Morninngcat   | 5911   |
+------------+-------------+---------------+--------+
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
For company 1, Max salary is 21300. Employees in company 1 have taxes = 49%
For company 2, Max salary is 700. Employees in company 2 have taxes = 0%
For company 3, Max salary is 7777. Employees in company 3 have taxes = 24%
The salary after taxes = salary - (taxes percentage / 100) * salary
For example, Salary for Morninngcat (3, 15) after taxes = 7777 - 7777 * (24 / 100) = 7777 - 1866.48 = 5910.52, which is rounded to 5911.
