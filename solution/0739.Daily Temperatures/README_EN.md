# Daily Temperatures

Given a list of daily temperatures **_T_**, return a list such that, for each day in the input, tells you how many days you would have to wait until a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, put **_0_** instead.

## Example :
```
    Input: [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73]
    Output: [1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0]
```

**Note:** The length of **temperatures** will be in the range **[1, 30000]**. Each temperature will be an integer in the range **[30, 100]**.
