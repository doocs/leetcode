<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
User 101:
    - Spent 10 * 10 = 100 on product 1.
    - Spent 7 * 15 = 105 on product 3.
User 101 spent the most money on product 3.
User 102:
    - Spent (9 + 7) * 10 = 150 on product 1.
    - Spent 6 * 25 = 150 on product 2.
    - Spent 10 * 15 = 150 on product 3.
User 102 spent the most money on products 1, 2, and 3.
