<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
- During the first week of November 2023, transactions amounting to $5,117 occurred on Friday, 2023-11-03.
- For the second week of November 2023, there were no transactions on Friday, 2023-11-10, resulting in a value of 0 in the output table for that day.
- Similarly, during the third week of November 2023, there were no transactions on Friday, 2023-11-17, reflected as 0 in the output table for that specific day.
- In the fourth week of November 2023, two transactions took place on Friday, 2023-11-24, amounting to $12,000 and $9,692 respectively, summing up to a total of $21,692.
