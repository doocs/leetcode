# [382. Linked List Random Node](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-random-node)

## Description
<p>Given a singly linked list, return a random node's value from the linked list. Each node must have the <b>same probability</b> of being chosen.</p>

<p><b>Follow up:</b><br />
What if the linked list is extremely large and its length is unknown to you? Could you solve this efficiently without using extra space?
</p>

<p><b>Example:</b>
<pre>
// Init a singly linked list [1,2,3].
ListNode head = new ListNode(1);
head.next = new ListNode(2);
head.next.next = new ListNode(3);
Solution solution = new Solution(head);

// getRandom() should return either 1, 2, or 3 randomly. Each element should have equal probability of returning.
solution.getRandom();
</pre>
