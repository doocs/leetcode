# [310. Minimum Height Trees](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-height-trees)

## Description
<p>For an undirected graph with tree characteristics, we can choose any node as the root. The result graph is then a rooted tree. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height are called minimum height trees (MHTs). Given such a graph, write a function to find all the MHTs and return a list of their root labels.</p>

<p><b>Format</b><br />
The graph contains <code>n</code> nodes which are labeled from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code>. You will be given the number <code>n</code> and a list of undirected <code>edges</code> (each edge is a pair of labels).</p>

<p>You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in <code>edges</code>. Since all edges are undirected, <code>[0, 1]</code> is the same as <code>[1, 0]</code> and thus will not appear together in <code>edges</code>.</p>

<p><b>Example 1 :</b></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> <code>n = 4</code>, <code>edges = [[1, 0], [1, 2], [1, 3]]</code>

<strong>Output:</strong> <code>[1]</code>

<p><b>Example 2 :</b></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> <code>n = 6</code>, <code>edges = [[0, 3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [4, 3], [5, 4]]</code>

<ul>
	<li>According to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory)" target="_blank">definition of tree on Wikipedia</a>: &ldquo;a tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by <i>exactly</i> one path. In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree.&rdquo;</li>
	<li>The height of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf.</li>
