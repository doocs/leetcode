## Description

<p>We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:</p>

<p>I pick a number from <strong>1</strong> to <strong>n</strong>. You have to guess which number I picked.</p>

<p>Every time you guess wrong, I&#39;ll tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower.</p>

<p>However, when you guess a particular number x, and you guess wrong, you pay <b>$x</b>. You win the game when you guess the number I picked.</p>

<p><b>Example:</b></p>

<pre>

n = 10, I pick 8.



First round:  You guess 5, I tell you that it&#39;s higher. You pay $5.

Second round: You guess 7, I tell you that it&#39;s higher. You pay $7.

Third round:  You guess 9, I tell you that it&#39;s lower. You pay $9.



Game over. 8 is the number I picked.



You end up paying $5 + $7 + $9 = $21.

</pre>

<p>Given a particular <strong>n &ge; 1</strong>, find out how much money you need to have to guarantee a <b>win</b>.</p>
