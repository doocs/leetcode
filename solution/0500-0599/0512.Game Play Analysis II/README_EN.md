## Description

<p>Table:&nbsp;<code>Activity</code></p>

<p>Write a&nbsp;SQL query that reports&nbsp;the <strong>device</strong>&nbsp;that is first logged in&nbsp;for each player.</p>

<p>The query result format is in the following example:</p>

<pre>
Activity table:
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |
| 1         | 2         | 2016-05-02 | 6            |
| 2         | 3         | 2017-06-25 | 1            |
| 3         | 1         | 2016-03-02 | 0            |
| 3         | 4         | 2018-07-03 | 5            |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+

Result table:
+-----------+-----------+
| player_id | device_id |
+-----------+-----------+
| 1         | 2         |
| 2         | 3         |
| 3         | 1         |
