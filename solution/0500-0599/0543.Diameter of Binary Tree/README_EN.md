# [543. Diameter of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree)

[中文文档](/solution/0500-0599/0543.Diameter%20of%20Binary%20Tree/README.md)

## Description
<p>

Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the <b>longest</b> path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

</p>



<p>

<b>Example:</b><br />

Given a binary tree <br />

<pre>

          1

         / \

        2   3

       / \     

      4   5    

</pre>

</p>

<p>

Return <b>3</b>, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

</p>



<p><b>Note:</b>

The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.
