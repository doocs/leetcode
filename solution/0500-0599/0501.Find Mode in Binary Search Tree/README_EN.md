# [501. Find Mode in Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-mode-in-binary-search-tree)

[中文文档](/solution/0500-0599/0501.Find%20Mode%20in%20Binary%20Search%20Tree/README.md)

## Description

<p>Given a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, find all the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(statistics)" target="_blank">mode(s)</a> (the most frequently occurred element) in the given BST.</p>

<p>Assume a BST is defined as follows:</p>

<ul>

    <li>The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys <b>less than or equal to</b> the node&#39;s key.</li>

    <li>The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys <b>greater than or equal to</b> the node&#39;s key.</li>

    <li>Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.</li>

</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example:<br />

Given BST <code>[1,null,2,2]</code>,</p>

<pre>

   1

    \

     2

    /

   2

</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>return <code>[2]</code>.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> If a tree has more than one mode, you can return them in any order.</p>

<p><b>Follow up:</b> Could you do that without using any extra space? (Assume that the implicit stack space incurred due to recursion does not count).</p>
