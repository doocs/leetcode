# [526. Beautiful Arrangement](https://leetcode.com/problems/beautiful-arrangement)

## Description
<p>Suppose you have <b>N</b> integers from 1 to N. We define a beautiful arrangement as an array that is constructed by these <b>N</b> numbers successfully if one of the following is true for the i<sub>th</sub> position (1 &lt;= i &lt;= N) in this array:</p>



<ol>

	<li>The number at the i<sub>th</sub> position is divisible by <b>i</b>.</li>

	<li><b>i</b> is divisible by the number at the i<sub>th</sub> position.</li>

</ol>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now given N, how many beautiful arrangements can you construct?</p>



<p><b>Example 1:</b></p>



<pre>

<b>Input:</b> 2

<b>Output:</b> 2

<b>Explanation:</b> 



The first beautiful arrangement is [1, 2]:



Number at the 1st position (i=1) is 1, and 1 is divisible by i (i=1).



Number at the 2nd position (i=2) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=2).



The second beautiful arrangement is [2, 1]:



Number at the 1st position (i=1) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=1).



Number at the 2nd position (i=2) is 1, and i (i=2) is divisible by 1.

<p><b>Note:</b></p>



<ol>

	<li><b>N</b> is a positive integer and will not exceed 15.</li>

</ol>
