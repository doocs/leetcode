[中文文档](/solution/0500-0599/0594.Longest%20Harmonious%20Subsequence/README.md)

## Description

<p>We define a harmounious array as an array where the difference between its maximum value and its minimum value is <b>exactly</b> 1.</p>

<p>Now, given an integer array, you need to find the length of its longest harmonious subsequence among all its possible <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsequence">subsequences</a>.</p>

<p><b>Example 1:</b></p>

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> [1,3,2,2,5,2,3,7]
<b>Output:</b> 5
<b>Explanation:</b> The longest harmonious subsequence is [3,2,2,2,3].
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> The length of the input array will not exceed 20,000.</p>
