[中文文档](/solution/0500-0599/0599.Minimum%20Index%20Sum%20of%20Two%20Lists/README.md)

## Description

<p>

Suppose Andy and Doris want to choose a restaurant for dinner, and they both have a list of favorite restaurants represented by strings.

</p>

<p>

You need to help them find out their <b>common interest</b> with the <b>least list index sum</b>. If there is a choice tie between answers, output all of them with no order requirement. You could assume there always exists an answer.

</p>

<p><b>Example 1:</b><br />

<pre>

<b>Input:</b>

["Shogun", "Tapioca Express", "Burger King", "KFC"]

["Piatti", "The Grill at Torrey Pines", "Hungry Hunter Steakhouse", "Shogun"]

<b>Output:</b> ["Shogun"]

<b>Explanation:</b> The only restaurant they both like is "Shogun".

</pre>

</p>

<p><b>Example 2:</b><br />

<pre>

<b>Input:</b>

["Shogun", "Tapioca Express", "Burger King", "KFC"]

["KFC", "Shogun", "Burger King"]

<b>Output:</b> ["Shogun"]

<b>Explanation:</b> The restaurant they both like and have the least index sum is "Shogun" with index sum 1 (0+1).

</pre>

</p>

<p><b>Note:</b><br>

<ol>

<li>The length of both lists will be in the range of [1, 1000].</li>

<li>The length of strings in both lists will be in the range of [1, 30].</li>

<li>The index is starting from 0 to the list length minus 1.</li>

<li>No duplicates in both lists.</li>

</ol>
