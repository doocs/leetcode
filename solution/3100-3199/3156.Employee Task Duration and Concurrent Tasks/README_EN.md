## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>Table: <code>Tasks</code></p>

<pre>
+---------------+----------+
| Column Name   | Type     |
+---------------+----------+
| task_id       | int      |
| employee_id   | int      |
| start_time    | datetime |
| end_time      | datetime |
+---------------+----------+
(task_id, employee_id) is the primary key for this table.
Each row in this table contains the task identifier, the employee identifier, and the start and end times of each task.
</pre>

<p>Write a solution to find the <strong>total duration</strong> of tasks for <strong>each</strong> employee and the <strong>maximum number of concurrent tasks</strong> an employee handled at <strong>any point in time</strong>. The total duration should be <strong>rounded down</strong> to the nearest number of <strong>full hours</strong>.</p>

<p>Return <em>the result table ordered by</em>&nbsp;<code>employee_id</code><strong> <em>ascending</em></strong><em> order</em>.</p>

<p>The result format is in the following example.</p>

<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>For employee ID 1001:
	<ul>
		<li>Task 1 and Task 2 overlap from 08:30 to 09:00 (30 minutes).</li>
		<li>Task 7 has a duration of 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes).</li>
		<li>Total task time: 60 (Task 1) + 120 (Task 2) + 60 (Task 3) + 150 (Task 7) - 30 (overlap) = 360 minutes = 6 hours.</li>
		<li>Maximum concurrent tasks: 2 (during the overlap period).</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>For employee ID 1002:
	<ul>
		<li>Task 4 and Task 5 overlap from 09:30 to 10:00 (30 minutes).</li>
		<li>Total task time: 60 (Task 4) + 120 (Task 5) - 30 (overlap) = 150 minutes = 2 hours and 30 minutes.</li>
		<li>Total task hours (rounded down): 2 hours.</li>
		<li>Maximum concurrent tasks: 2 (during the overlap period).</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>For employee ID 1003:
	<ul>
		<li>No overlapping tasks.</li>
		<li>Total task time: 120 minutes = 2 hours.</li>
		<li>Maximum concurrent tasks: 1.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Note:</b> Output table is ordered by employee_id in ascending order.</p>

## Solutions

<!-- solution:start -->

### Solution 1: Merge + Join

First, we merge the `start_time` and `end_time` for each `employee_id` into a new table `T`. Then, using the `LEAD` function, we calculate the start time of the next task for each employee. Next, we join table `T` with the `Tasks` table to compute the concurrent task count for each employee. Finally, we group by `employee_id` to calculate the total task duration and the maximum concurrent tasks for each employee.

#### MySQL

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
WITH
    T AS (
        SELECT DISTINCT employee_id, start_time AS st
        FROM Tasks
        UNION DISTINCT
        SELECT DISTINCT employee_id, end_time AS st
        FROM Tasks
    ),
    P AS (
        SELECT
            *,
            LEAD(st) OVER (
                PARTITION BY employee_id
                ORDER BY st
            ) AS ed
        FROM T
    ),
    S AS (
        SELECT
            P.*,
            COUNT(1) AS concurrent_count
        FROM
            P
            INNER JOIN Tasks USING (employee_id)
        WHERE P.st >= Tasks.start_time AND P.ed <= Tasks.end_time
        GROUP BY 1, 2, 3
    )
SELECT
    employee_id,
    FLOOR(SUM(TIME_TO_SEC(TIMEDIFF(ed, st)) / 3600)) AS total_task_hours,
    MAX(concurrent_count) AS max_concurrent_tasks
FROM S
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
