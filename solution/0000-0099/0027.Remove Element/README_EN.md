# [27. Remove Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element)

## Description
<p>Given an array <em>nums</em> and a value <em>val</em>, remove all instances of that value <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm" target="_blank"><strong>in-place</strong></a> and return the new length.</p>

<p>Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by <strong>modifying the input array <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm" target="_blank">in-place</a></strong> with O(1) extra memory.</p>

<p>The order of elements can be changed. It doesn&#39;t matter what you leave beyond the new length.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
Given <em>nums</em> = <strong>[3,2,2,3]</strong>, <em>val</em> = <strong>3</strong>,

Your function should return length = <strong>2</strong>, with the first two elements of <em>nums</em> being <strong>2</strong>.

It doesn&#39;t matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
Given <em>nums</em> = <strong>[0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2]</strong>, <em>val</em> = <strong>2</strong>,

Your function should return length = <strong><code>5</code></strong>, with the first five elements of <em><code>nums</code></em> containing&nbsp;<strong><code>0</code></strong>, <strong><code>1</code></strong>, <strong><code>3</code></strong>, <strong><code>0</code></strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>4</strong>.

Note that the order of those five elements can be arbitrary.

It doesn&#39;t matter what values are set beyond&nbsp;the returned length.</pre>

<p><strong>Clarification:</strong></p>

<p>Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?</p>

<p>Note that the input array is passed in by <strong>reference</strong>, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.</p>

<p>Internally you can think of this:</p>

<pre>
// <strong>nums</strong> is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeElement(nums, val);

// any modification to <strong>nums</strong> in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first <strong>len</strong> elements.
for (int i = 0; i &lt; len; i++) {
&nbsp; &nbsp; print(nums[i]);
}</pre>
