# [160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists)

[中文文档](/solution/0100-0199/0160.Intersection%20of%20Two%20Linked%20Lists/README.md)

## Description

<p>Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.</p>

<p>For example, the following two linked lists:</p>

![](./images/160_statement.png)

<p>begin to intersect at node c1.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

![](./images/160_example_1.png)

<pre>

<strong>Input: </strong>intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,0,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3

<strong>Output:</strong> Reference of the node with value = 8

<strong>Input Explanation:</strong> The intersected node&#39;s value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,0,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

![](./images/160_example_2.png)

<pre>

<strong>Input: </strong>intersectVal&nbsp;= 2, listA = [0,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1

<strong>Output:</strong> Reference of the node with value = 2

<strong>Input Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;The intersected node&#39;s value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [0,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.

</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>

![](./images/160_example_3.png)

<pre>

<strong>Input: </strong>intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2

<strong>Output:</strong> null

<strong>Input Explanation:</strong> From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.

<strong>Explanation:</strong> The two lists do not intersect, so return null.

</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Notes:</b></p>

<ul>
	<li>If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return <code>null</code>.</li>
	<li>The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.</li>
	<li>You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.</li>
	<li>Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.</li>
</ul>
