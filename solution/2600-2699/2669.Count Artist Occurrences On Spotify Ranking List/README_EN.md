<p>Table: <code><font face="monospace">Spotify</font></code></p>

<pre>

<code>id</code> is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row contains an id, track_name, and artist.
</pre>

<p>Write a solution to find how many times each artist appeared on the Spotify ranking list.</p>

<p>Return the result table having the artist&#39;s name along with the corresponding number of occurrences&nbsp;ordered by occurrence count in&nbsp;<strong>descending </strong>order. If the occurrences are equal, then it&rsquo;s ordered by the artist&rsquo;s name in <strong>ascending</strong> order.</p>

<p>The result format is in the following example​​​​​.</p>
