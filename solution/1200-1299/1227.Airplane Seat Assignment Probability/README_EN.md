## Description
<p><code data-stringify-type="code">n</code>&nbsp;passengers board an airplane with exactly&nbsp;<code data-stringify-type="code">n</code>&nbsp;seats. The first passenger has lost the ticket and picks a seat randomly. But after that, the rest of passengers will:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Take their own seat if it is still available,&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Pick other seats randomly when they find their seat occupied&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>What is the probability that the n-th person can get his own seat?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> n = 1
<strong>Output:</strong> 1.00000
<strong>Explanation: </strong>The first person can only get the first seat.</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> n = 2
<strong>Output:</strong> 0.50000
<strong>Explanation: </strong>The second person has a probability of 0.5 to get the second seat (when first person gets the first seat).
