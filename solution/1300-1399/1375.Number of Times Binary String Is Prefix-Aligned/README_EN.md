# [1375. Number of Times Binary String Is Prefix-Aligned](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-times-binary-string-is-prefix-aligned)

[中文文档](/solution/1300-1399/1375.Number%20of%20Times%20Binary%20String%20Is%20Prefix-Aligned/README.md)

## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>You have a <strong>1-indexed</strong> binary string of length <code>n</code> where all the bits are <code>0</code> initially. We will flip all the bits of this binary string (i.e., change them from <code>0</code> to <code>1</code>) one by one. You are given a <strong>1-indexed</strong> integer array <code>flips</code> where <code>flips[i]</code> indicates that the bit at index <code>flips[i]</code> will be flipped in the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> step.</p>

<p>A binary string is <strong>prefix-aligned</strong> if, after the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> step, all the bits in the <strong>inclusive</strong> range <code>[1, i]</code> are ones and all the other bits are zeros.</p>

<p>Return <em>the number of times the binary string is <strong>prefix-aligned</strong> during the flipping process</em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> flips = [3,2,4,1,5]
<strong>Output:</strong> 2
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The binary string is initially &quot;00000&quot;.
After applying step 1: The string becomes &quot;00100&quot;, which is not prefix-aligned.
After applying step 2: The string becomes &quot;01100&quot;, which is not prefix-aligned.
After applying step 3: The string becomes &quot;01110&quot;, which is not prefix-aligned.
After applying step 4: The string becomes &quot;11110&quot;, which is prefix-aligned.
After applying step 5: The string becomes &quot;11111&quot;, which is prefix-aligned.
We can see that the string was prefix-aligned 2 times, so we return 2.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> flips = [4,1,2,3]
<strong>Output:</strong> 1
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The binary string is initially &quot;0000&quot;.
After applying step 1: The string becomes &quot;0001&quot;, which is not prefix-aligned.
After applying step 2: The string becomes &quot;1001&quot;, which is not prefix-aligned.
After applying step 3: The string becomes &quot;1101&quot;, which is not prefix-aligned.
After applying step 4: The string becomes &quot;1111&quot;, which is prefix-aligned.
We can see that the string was prefix-aligned 1 time, so we return 1.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>n == flips.length</code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= n &lt;= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>flips</code> is a permutation of the integers in the range <code>[1, n]</code>.</li>
</ul>

## Solutions

<!-- solution:start -->

### Solution 1: Direct Traversal

We can traverse the array $flips$, keeping track of the maximum value $mx$ of the elements we have traversed so far. If $mx$ equals the current index $i$ we are traversing, it means that the first $i$ elements have all been flipped, i.e., the prefix is consistent, and we increment the answer.

After the traversal is finished, we return the answer.

The time complexity is $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the array $flips$. The space complexity is $O(1)$.

#### Python3

```python
class Solution:
    def numTimesAllBlue(self, flips: List[int]) -> int:
        ans = mx = 0
        for i, x in enumerate(flips, 1):
            mx = max(mx, x)
            ans += mx == i
        return ans
```

#### Java

```java
class Solution {
    public int numTimesAllBlue(int[] flips) {
        int ans = 0, mx = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= flips.length; ++i) {
            mx = Math.max(mx, flips[i - 1]);
            if (mx == i) {
                ++ans;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

#### C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numTimesAllBlue(vector<int>& flips) {
        int ans = 0, mx = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= flips.size(); ++i) {
            mx = max(mx, flips[i - 1]);
            ans += mx == i;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

#### Go

```go
func numTimesAllBlue(flips []int) (ans int) {
	mx := 0
	for i, x := range flips {
		mx = max(mx, x)
		if mx == i+1 {
			ans++
		}
	}
	return
}
```

#### TypeScript

```ts
function numTimesAllBlue(flips: number[]): number {
    let ans = 0;
    let mx = 0;
    for (let i = 1; i <= flips.length; ++i) {
        mx = Math.max(mx, flips[i - 1]);
        if (mx === i) {
            ++ans;
        }
    }
    return ans;
}
```
