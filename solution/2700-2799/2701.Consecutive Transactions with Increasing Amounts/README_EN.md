## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>Table: <code>Transactions</code></p>

<pre>
+------------------+------+
| Column Name      | Type |
+------------------+------+
| transaction_id   | int  |
| customer_id      | int  |
| transaction_date | date |
| amount           | int  |
+------------------+------+
transaction_id is the primary key of this table. 
Each row contains information about transactions that includes unique (customer_id, transaction_date) along with the corresponding customer_id and amount.  
</pre>

<p>Write an SQL query to find the customers who have made consecutive transactions with increasing <code>amount</code>&nbsp;for at least three consecutive days. Include the <code>customer_id</code>,&nbsp;start date of the consecutive transactions&nbsp;period and the end date of the consecutive transactions period. There can be multiple consecutive transactions by a customer.</p>

<p>Return <em>the result table ordered by</em> <code>customer_id, consecutive_start, consecutive_end</code> <em>in <strong>ascending</strong> order.</em></p>

<p>The query result format is in the following example.</p>

<strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;
- customer_id 101 has made consecutive transactions with increasing amounts from May 1st, 2023, to May 3rd, 2023
- customer_id 102 does not have any consecutive transactions for at least 3 days.&nbsp;
- customer_id 105 has two sets of consecutive transactions: from May 1st, 2023, to May 4th, 2023, and from May 12th, 2023, to May 14th, 2023.&nbsp;
customer_id is sorted in ascending order.

#### MySQL

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
WITH
    T AS (
        SELECT
            t1.*,
            SUM(
                CASE
                    WHEN t2.customer_id IS NULL THEN 1
                    ELSE 0
                END
            ) OVER (ORDER BY customer_id, transaction_date) AS s
        FROM
            Transactions AS t1
            LEFT JOIN Transactions AS t2
                ON t1.customer_id = t2.customer_id
                AND t1.amount > t2.amount
                AND DATEDIFF(t1.transaction_date, t2.transaction_date) = 1
    )
SELECT
    customer_id,
    MIN(transaction_date) AS consecutive_start,
    MAX(transaction_date) AS consecutive_end
FROM T
GROUP BY customer_id, s
HAVING COUNT(1) >= 3
ORDER BY customer_id;
```
