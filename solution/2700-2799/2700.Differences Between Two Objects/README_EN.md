# [2700. Differences Between Two Objects ðŸ”’](https://leetcode.com/problems/differences-between-two-objects)

[ä¸­æ–‡æ–‡æ¡£](/solution/2700-2799/2700.Differences%20Between%20Two%20Objects/README.md)

## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>Write a function that accepts two deeply nested objects or arrays&nbsp;<code>obj1</code> and&nbsp;<code>obj2</code>&nbsp;and returns a new&nbsp;object representing their differences.</p>

<p>The function should compare the properties of the two objects and identify any changes.&nbsp;The returned object should only contains keys where the value is different from&nbsp;<code>obj1</code> to&nbsp;<code>obj2</code>.</p>

<p>For each changed key, the value should be represented as an&nbsp;array <code>[obj1 value, obj2&nbsp;value]</code>. Keys that exist in one object but not in the other should not be included in the returned object.&nbsp;The end result should be a deeply nested object where each leaf value is a difference array.</p>

<p>When comparing two arrays, the indices of the arrays are considered to be their keys.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You may assume that both objects are the output of <code>JSON.parse</code>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> 
obj1 = {}
obj2 = {
&nbsp; &quot;a&quot;: 1, 
  &quot;b&quot;: 2
}
<strong>Output:</strong> {}
<strong>Explanation:</strong> There were no modifications made to obj1. New keys &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; appear in obj2, but keys that are added or removed should be ignored.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> 
obj1 = {
&nbsp; &quot;a&quot;: 1,
&nbsp; &quot;v&quot;: 3,
&nbsp; &quot;x&quot;: [],
&nbsp; &quot;z&quot;: {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;a&quot;: null
&nbsp; }
}
obj2 = {
&nbsp; &quot;a&quot;: 2,
&nbsp; &quot;v&quot;: 4,
&nbsp; &quot;x&quot;: [],
&nbsp; &quot;z&quot;: {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;a&quot;: 2
&nbsp; }
}
<strong>Output:</strong> 
{
&nbsp; &quot;a&quot;: [1, 2],
  &quot;v&quot;: [3, 4],
&nbsp; &quot;z&quot;: {
&nbsp;   &quot;a&quot;: [null, 2]
&nbsp; }
}
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The keys &quot;a&quot;, &quot;v&quot;, and &quot;z&quot; all had changes applied. &quot;a&quot; was changed from 1 to 2. &quot;v&quot; was changed from 3 to 4. &quot;z&quot; had a change applied to a child object. &quot;z.a&quot; was changed from null to 2.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> 
obj1 = {
&nbsp; &quot;a&quot;: 5, 
&nbsp; &quot;v&quot;: 6, 
&nbsp; &quot;z&quot;: [1, 2, 4, [2, 5, 7]]
}
obj2 = {
&nbsp; &quot;a&quot;: 5, 
&nbsp; &quot;v&quot;: 7, 
&nbsp; &quot;z&quot;: [1, 2, 3, [1]]
}
<strong>Output:</strong> 
{
&nbsp; &quot;v&quot;: [6, 7],
&nbsp; &quot;z&quot;: {
&nbsp;   &quot;2&quot;: [4, 3],
&nbsp;   &quot;3&quot;: {
&nbsp;     &quot;0&quot;: [2, 1]
&nbsp;   }
&nbsp; }
}
<strong>Explanation:</strong> In obj1 and obj2, the keys &quot;v&quot; and &quot;z&quot; have different assigned values. &quot;a&quot; is ignored because the value is unchanged. In the key &quot;z&quot;, there is a nested array. Arrays are treated like objects where the indices are keys. There were two alterations to the the array: z[2] and z[3][0]. z[0] and z[1] were unchanged and thus not included. z[3][1] and z[3][2] were removed and thus not included.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 4:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> 
obj1 = {
&nbsp; &quot;a&quot;: {&quot;b&quot;: 1}, 
}
obj2 = {
&nbsp; &quot;a&quot;: [5],
}
<strong>Output:</strong> 
{
  &quot;a&quot;: [{&quot;b&quot;: 1}, [5]]
}
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The key &quot;a&quot; exists in both objects. Since the two associated values have different types, they are placed in the difference array.</pre>

<p><strong>Example 5:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> 
obj1 = {
&nbsp; &quot;a&quot;: [1, 2, {}], 
&nbsp; &quot;b&quot;: false
}
obj2 = { &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &quot;b&quot;: false,
&nbsp; &quot;a&quot;: [1, 2, {}]
}
<strong>Output:</strong> 
{}
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Apart from a different ordering of keys, the two objects are identical so an empty object is returned.</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>obj1</code> and <code>obj2</code> are valid JSON objects or arrays</li>
	<li><code>2 &lt;= JSON.stringify(obj1).length &lt;= 10<sup>4</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>2 &lt;= JSON.stringify(obj2).length &lt;= 10<sup>4</sup></code></li>
</ul>

## Solutions

### Solution 1

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### TypeScript

```ts
function objDiff(obj1: any, obj2: any): any {
    if (type(obj1) !== type(obj2)) return [obj1, obj2];
    if (!isObject(obj1)) return obj1 === obj2 ? {} : [obj1, obj2];
    const diff: Record<string, unknown> = {};
    const sameKeys = Object.keys(obj1).filter(key => key in obj2);
    sameKeys.forEach(key => {
        const subDiff = objDiff(obj1[key], obj2[key]);
        if (Object.keys(subDiff).length) diff[key] = subDiff;
    });
    return diff;
}

function type(obj: unknown): string {
    return Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).slice(8, -1);
}

function isObject(obj: unknown): obj is Record<string, unknown> {
    return typeof obj === 'object' && obj !== null;
}
```
