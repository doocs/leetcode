[中文文档](/lcci/16.14.Best%20Line/README.md)

## Description

<p>Given a two-dimensional graph with points on it, find a line which passes the most number of points.</p>

<p>Assume all the points that passed by the line are stored in list <code>S</code>&nbsp;sorted by their number. You need to return <code>[S[0], S[1]]</code>, that is , two points that have smallest number. If there are more than one line that passes the most number of points, choose the one that has the smallest <code>S[0].</code>&nbsp;If there are more that one line that has the same <code>S[0]</code>, choose the one that has smallest <code>S[1]</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Example: </strong></p>

<pre>



<strong>Input: </strong> [[0,0],[1,1],[1,0],[2,0]]



<strong>Output: </strong> [0,2]



<strong>Explanation: </strong> The numbers of points passed by the line are [0,2,3].



</pre>

<p><strong>Note: </strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>2 &lt;= len(Points) &lt;= 300</code></li>
	<li><code>len(Points[i]) = 2</code></li>
</ul>
