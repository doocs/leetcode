# [04.12. Paths with Sum](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/paths-with-sum-lcci)

## Description
<p>You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer value (which might be positive or negative). Design an algorithm to count the number of paths that sum to a given value. The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).</p>



<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />

Given the following tree and &nbsp;<code>sum = 22,</code></p>



<pre>

              5

             / \

            4   8

           /   / \

          11  13  4

         /  \    / \

        7    2  5   1

</pre>



<p>Output:</p>



<pre>

3

<strong>Explanation: </strong>Paths that have sum 22 are: [5,4,11,2], [5,8,4,5], [4,11,7]</pre>



<p>Note:</p>



<ul>
	<li><code>node number &lt;= 10000</code></li>
</ul>
