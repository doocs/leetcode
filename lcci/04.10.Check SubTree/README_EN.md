# [04.10. Check SubTree](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/check-subtree-lcci)

## Description
<p>T1&nbsp;and T2 are two very large binary trees, with T1&nbsp;much bigger than T2. Create an algorithm to determine if T2 is a subtree of T1.</p>



<p>A tree T2 is a subtree of T1&nbsp;if there exists a node n in T1&nbsp;such that the subtree of n is identical to T2. That is, if you cut off the tree at node n, the two trees would be identical.</p>



<p><strong>Example1:</strong></p>



<pre>

<strong> Input</strong>: t1 = [1, 2, 3], t2 = [2]

<strong> Output</strong>: true

</pre>



<p><strong>Example2:</strong></p>



<pre>

<strong> Input</strong>: t1 = [1, null, 2, 4], t2 = [3, 2]

<strong> Output</strong>: false

</pre>



<p><strong>Note: </strong></p>



<ol>
	<li>The node numbers of both tree are in [0, 20000].</li>
</ol>
